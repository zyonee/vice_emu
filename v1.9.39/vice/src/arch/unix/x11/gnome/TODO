Missing features
- Drag'n'Drop support
- Session Management

Known Bugs (help is appreciated !):
- x128 gives a GTK warning because topmenu is reused. However this seems not
  to be a problem.
- Gnome commandline is ignored.
- Get font from X Resource database for textwindows/CBM font preview windows.

Things, which will change (don't ask when!):
- Tape status widget (.TAP vs .t64) handling is lousy.
- Monitor GUI
- VIC20 Cartridge attach heuristic for image pairs
- More standard Gnome'ish toplevel menus.
