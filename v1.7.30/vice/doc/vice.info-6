   VICE derives from X64, the first Commodore 64 emulator for the X
Window System.  Here is an informal list of the people who were mostly
involved in the development of X64 and VICE:

   The VICE core team:

   * Ettore Perazzoli (<ettore@comm2000.it>) made the 6510, VIC-II,
     VIC-I and CRTC emulations, part of the hardware-level 1541
     emulation, speed optimizations, bug fixes, the event-driven
     cycle-exact engine, the Xt/Xaw/Xfwf-based GUI for X11, a general
     code reorganization, the new resource handling, most of the
     documentation.  He also wrote the MS-DOS port and the initial
     MS-Windows port (well, somebody had to do it).

   * Daniel Sladic (<sladic@eecg.toronto.edu>) started the work on
     hardware-level 1541 emulation and wrote the new monitor introduced
     with VICE 0.15.

   * Andreas Boose (<boose@linux.rz.fh-hannover.de>) gave lots of
     information and bug reports about the VIC-II, the 6510 and the
     CIAs; moreover, he wrote several test-routines that were used to
     improve the emulation.  He also added cartridge support and has
     been the main head behind the drive and datasette emulation since
     version 0.15.  Also added several UI elements to the MSDOS and
     MS-Windows ports and the C128 Z80 implementation.

   * Dag Lem (<resid@nimrod.no>) implemented the reSID SID emulation
     engine.

   * Tibor Biczo (<crown@mail.matav.hu>) improved the MS-Windows port.

   * Andreas Dehmel (<dehmel@forwiss.tu-muenchen.de>) wrote the Acorn
     RISC OS port.

   * Thomas Bretz (<tbretz@ph.tum.de>) responsible for the OS/2 port.

   * Andreas Matthies (<andreas.matthies@gmx.net>) improved the
     datasette support, the VIC20 video emulation and some ui stuff in
     the Win32 and MSDOS port. Wrote the BeOS port.

   * Martin Pottendorfer (<Martin.Pottendorfer@aut.alcatel.at>)
     Implemented Gnome Port based on Oliver Schaertels GTK+ port Added
     support code for internationalization based on gettext Translated
     the Unix Port to German Implemented the fliplists + ui (unix).

   * Markus Brenner (<markus@brenner.de>) added VDC emulation to x128.

   Former team members:

   * Andre Fachat (<fachat@physik.tu-chemnitz.de>) wrote the PET and
     CBM-II emulators, the CIA and VIA emulation, the IEEE488
     interface, implemented the IEC serial bus in `xvic' and made tons
     of bug fixes.

   * Teemu Rantanen (<tvr@cs.hut.fi>) implemented the SID emulation and
     the trap-based disk drive and serial bus implementation; added
     support for multiple display depths under X11.  Also wrote `c1541'

   * Jouko Valta (<jopi@stekt.oulu.fi>) wrote `petcat' and `c1541',
     `T64' handling, user service and maintenance (most of the work in
     x64 0.3.x was made by him); retired from the project in July 96,
     after VICE 0.10.0.

   * Jarkko Sonninen (<sonninen@lut.fi>) was the founder of the
     project, wrote the old version of the 6502 emulation and the
     XDebugger, and retired from the project after x64 0.2.1.

   External contributors:

   * Michael Schwendt (<sidplay@geocities.com>) helped with the SID
     (audio) chip emulation, bringing important suggestions and bug
     reports, as well as the wave tables and filter emulation from his
     SIDplay emulator.

   * Christian Bauer (<bauec002@goofy.zdv.uni-mainz.de>) wrote the very
     interesting "VIC article" from which we got invaluable information
     about the VIC-II chip: without this, the VIC-II implementation
     would have not been possible.

   * Wolfgang Lorenz wrote an excellent 6510 test suite that helped us
     to debug the CPU emulation.

   * Giuliano Procida (<gpp10@cam.ac.uk>) is the maintainer of the VICE
     `deb' package for the Debian distribution, and also helped
     proofreading the documentation.

   * Marko M"akel"a (<msmakela@nic.funet.fi>) wrote lots of CPU
     documentation.

   * Martin Pottendorfer (<Martin.Pottendorfer@aut.alcatel.at>)
     implemented the "Contents" button in the file selector and
     provided us with several suggestions and constant testing of
     constantly broken snapshots.

   * Chris Sharp (<sharpc@hurlsey.ibm.com>) wrote the AIX sound driver.

   * Krister Walfridsson (<cato@df.lth.se>) implemented joystick and
     sound support for NetBSD.

   * Mattias Engdeg^ard (<f91-men@nada.kth.se>) got non-default depths
     to work.

   * Peter Andrew Felvegi aka Petschy (<petschy@derceto.sch.bme.hu>)
     fixed a couple of bugs in the fast serial emulation.

   * Olaf Seibert (<rhialto@polder.ubc.kun.nl>) contributed some PET,
     and disk drive patches.

   * Alexander Lehmann (<alex@mathematik.th-darmstadt.de>) added
     complete support for all the VIC20 memory configurations for the
     old VICE 0.12.

   * Lionel Ulmer implemented joystick support for Linux and a first
     try of a SID emulation for SGI machines.

   * Bernhard Kuhn (<kuhn@eikon.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de>) made some
     joystick improvements for Linux.

   * Gerhard Wesp (<gwesp@cosy.sbg.ac.at>) contributed the `extract'
     command in `c1541'.

     version of the REU Emulation.

   * Vesa-Matti Puro (<vmp@lut.fi>) wrote the very first 6502 CPU
     emulator in x64 0.1.0.  That was the beginning of the story...

   * Dan Miner (<dminer@nyx10.cs.du.edu>) contributed some patches to
     the fast disk drive emulation.

   * Frank Prindle (<Frank.Prindle@lambada.oit.unc.edu>) contributed
     some patches.

   * Peter Weighill (<stuce@csv.warwick.ac.uk>) gave many ideas and
     contributed the ROM patcher.

VICE home page
==============

   You can find the latest news about VICE at the official VICE home
page:

     http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dsladic/vice/vice.html

   If you are going to report a bug, please check those pages *first*;
it is possible that the problem you encountered has already been fixed
with a newer version.


File: vice.info,  Node: Sending feedback,  Next: Contributing,  Prev: Home page,  Up: Contacts

How to send feedback
====================

   If you want to report bugs, make suggestions or contribute to the
project, please email one of the following people:

   * VICE Mailing List (<vice-devel@firenze.linux.it>) for all general
     questions, bug reports, suggestions.

   * Andreas Boose (<boose@linux.rz.fh-hannover.de>) for disk drive,
     tape, cartridge and Z80 emulation;

   * Andr'e Fachat (<fachat@physik.tu-chemnitz.de>) for the PETs and
     CBM-II;

   It's always nice to receive feedback and/or bugreports about VICE,
but please read these few notes before sending mail to anybody in the
team.

   * Please put the word `VICE' *in all capitals* in your subject line
     (e.g., `VICE fails to run game XXX').  This helps mail splitting
     and reduces chances that your message is unintentionally deleted,
     forgotten or lost.

   * Please don't send any HTML mail (we really hate that!).  If you use
     M$ Outlook or Netscape Communicator, make sure you turn off the
     "rich text" (HTML) feature.

   * Please don't send *any* binaries without asking first.

   * Please read the following documents carefully before reporting a
     bug or a problem you cannot solve:

        * the VICE documentation (you are reading it!);

        * the VICE FAQ (it is available on the Internet, and reachable
          from the VICE home page:
          http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dsladic/vice/vice.html);

        * the `comp.emulators.cbm' and `comp.sys.cbm' FAQs (*note FAQs
          you should read::.).

   * When you report a bug, please try to be as accurate as possible and
     describe how it can be reproduced to the very detail.  You should
     also tell us what machine you are running on, what operating
     system you are using as well as the version of it.

   * Please don't ask us how to transfer original C64 disk or tapes to
     your PC; this has been asked a gazillion times through email.  To
     transfer disks, you can use the Star Commander
     (http://ludens.elte.hu/~sta/sc.html).  And no, you cannot read C64
     disks with your old 5"1/4 PC drive.

   * Please don't ask us where to find games for the emulator on the
     Internet.

   * Please don't ask us when the next version will be out, because we
     really don't know.

   * Please write in English, or in the language of the person you are
     writing to (Andr'e and Andreas are German, Daniel is from Canada).

   In any case, we would be *really* glad to receive your comments
about VICE.  We cannot always answer all the email, but we surely read
all of it.

   Thanks!


File: vice.info,  Node: Contributing,  Next: Newsgroups,  Prev: Sending feedback,  Up: Contacts

How to contribute
=================

   If you want to make a major contribution, please *ask* first.  It
has already happened a couple of times that somebody started working at
something that had already been done but not released to the public yet,
and we really do *not* want anybody to waste time.

   If you are going to make a patch, please make sure the patch is
relative to the very latest version, and provide us with the following:

   * a diff file containing all the changes you have made (`diff -c' or
     `diff -u' (better) is fine; please don't use plain `diff');

   * GNU-style `ChangeLog' entries with a description of the changes you
     have made (look at the `ChangeLog's provided with the original VICE
     sources for an example).

   This is very important, and makes adding patches much smoother and
safer.

   People willing to port VICE to other platforms are always welcome.
Windows, A BeOS port is in the works, so if you are interested in this
platform, please let us know.  There is plenty of work to do and any
sort of help can be very useful.

Interesting newsgroups
======================

   There are some Usenet newsgroups you might be interested in:

   * `comp.emulators.cbm', discussing about emulators of Commodore 8-bit
     machines (definitely not Amiga emulators).

   * `comp.sys.cbm', discussing various topics regarding real Commodore
     8-bit machines.  This newsgroup is mainly for people who actually
     use original Commodore equipment (so please don't talk about
     emulation here).

   * `comp.emulators.misc', discussing emulators in general.

FAQs you should read
====================

   We recommend reading the `comp.emulators.cbm' and `comp.sys.cbm'
FAQs, which are posted regularly on the corresponding newsgroups and
are also available via FTP from ftp://rtfm.mit.edu.
