# This is a list for me to gather already identified problems. It's not 
# systematic and probably not complete!

Missing features
- Implement remaining dummy (fullscreen support is missing,).
- Implement 2 color LEDs
- Internationalization
- Session Management

Known Bugs (help is appreciated !):
- x128 gives a GTK warning because topmenu is reused.
- vsid mode doesn't work properly. Dag takes care of this.
- Gnome commandline is ignored.
- Get font from Xresource database for textwindows
- Setting the color palette twice leads to GTK/X error assertion (Help needed!)
  doesn't happen on my 16bit Xserver@home; problem maybe with 8bit color depth?
