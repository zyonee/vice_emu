   The PIA 6520 is a chip with two I/O ports (Parallel Interface
Adapter) and four additional handshake lines.  The chip is pretty the
same for Port A and B, only that Port A implements handshake on read
operation and port B on write operation.

TPI module
..........

   The TPI 6525 is a chip with three I/O ports (Tri-Port-Interface).
One of the ports can double as an interrupt prioritizer.  Therefore we
also have to save the states of the interrupt stack etc.

ACIA module
...........

   The ACIA 6551 is an RS232 interface chip.  VICE emulates RS232
connections via `/dev/ttyS*' (Unix) or `COM:' (DOS/WIN - not yet?).
When saving a snapshot, those connections are of course lost.  The
state of the ACIA however is restored if possible.  I.e. if a connection
is already open when restoring the snapshot, this connection is used
instead.  If no connection is open, a carrier/DTR drop is emulated.

PET memory module
.................

   The PET memory module actually consists of two modules.  The
"PETMEM" module is mandatory and contains the RAM dump.  The "PETROM"
module is optional and contains a dump of the ROM images.

   The size of the PET memory modules differs with each different memory
configuration.  The RAM configuration is saved in the snapshot, and
restored when the snapshot is loaded.

   Version numbers: Major 1, Minor 0

Monitor
*******

   Every VICE emulator has a complete built-in monitor, which can be
used to examine, disassemble and assemble machine language programs, as
well as debug them through breakpoints.  It can be activated by using
the "Activate monitor" command (left button menu).  Notice that you have
to run the emulator from a terminal emulation program (such as `rxvt'
or `xterm') in order to use the monitor.

   Warning: this version of the monitor is still under construction,
and some of the features are not fully working yet.

Terminology
===========

`address_space'
     This refers to the range of memory locations and a set of
     registers.  This can be the addresses available to the computer's
     processor, the disk drive's processor or a specific memory
     configuration of one of the mentioned processors.

`register'
     One of the following: program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP),
     accumulator (A), X register (X), or Y register (Y).

`address'
     A specific memory location in the range $0000 to $FFFF.

`address_range'
     Two addresses.  If the second address is less than the first, the
     range is assumed to wraparound from $FFFF to $0000.  Both
     addresses must be in the same address space.

`address_opt_range'
     An address or an address range.

`prompt'
     The prompt has the format [x:y].  If x is -, memory reads from the
     monitor do not have side effects.  Otherwise, x is S.  The second
     part of the prompt, y, shows the default address space.

`checkpoint'
     The monitor has the ability to setup triggers that perform an
     action when a specified situation occurs.  There are three types
     of checkpoints; breakpoints, tracepoints and watchpoints.

`breakpoint'
     A breakpoint is triggered based on the program counter.  When it is
     triggered, the monitor is entered.

`tracepoint'
     Like breakpoints, a tracepoint is triggered based on the program
     counter.  Instead of entering the monitor, the program counter is
     printed and execution continues.

`watchpoint'
     Watchpoints are triggered by a read and/or write to an address.
     When a watchpoint is triggered, the monitor is entered.

`<...>'
     A data type.

`*'
     Zero or more occurrences.

`[...]'
     An optional argument.


File: vice.info,  Node: Machine state commands,  Next: Memory commands,  Prev: Terminology,  Up: Monitor

Machine state commands
======================

`goto <address>'
     Change the PC to address and continue execution.

`io'
     Nothing yet.  Will display VIC/VIA/CIA/SID registers.

`next [<count>]'
     Advance to the next instruction.  Subroutines are treated as a
     single instruction.

`registers [<reg_name> = <number> [, <reg_name> = <number>]*]'
     Assign respective registers.  With no parameters, display register
     values.

`return'
     Continues execution  and returns to the monitor just
     before(after?) the next RTS or RTI is executed.

`step [<count>]'
     Single step through instructions.  An optional count allows
     stepping more than a single instruction at a time.


File: vice.info,  Node: Memory commands,  Next: Assembly commands,  Prev: Machine state commands,  Up: Monitor

Memory commands
===============

`compare <address_range> <address>'
     Compare memory from the source specified by the address range to
     the destination specified by the address.  The regions may
     overlap.  Any values that miscompare are displayed using the
     default displaytype.

`fill <address_range> <data_list>'
     Fill memory in the specified address range with the data in
     <data_list>.  If the size of the address range is greater than the
     size of the data_list, the data_list is repeated.

`hunt <address_range> <data_list>'
     Hunt memory in the specified address range for the data in
     <data_list>.  If the data is found, the starting address of the
     match is displayed.  The entire range is searched for all possible
     matches.

`i <address_opt_range>'
     Display memory contents as PETSCII text.

`m [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
     Display the contents of memory.  If no datatype is given, the
     default is used.  If only one address is specified, the length of
     data displayed is based on the datatype.  If no addresses are
     given, the 'dot' address is used.

`mc [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
     Display the contents of memory as character data.  If only one
     address is specified, only one character is displayed.  If no
     addresses are given, the "dot" address is used.

`ms [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
     Display the contents of memory as sprite data.  If only one
     address is specified, only one sprite is displayed.  If no
     addresses are given, the "dot" address is used.

`move <address_range> <address>'
     Move memory from the source specified by the address range to the
     destination specified by the address.  The regions may overlap.

`> [<address>] <data_list>'
     Write the specified data at `address'.

Assembly commands
=================

`a <address> [ <instruction> [: <instruction>]* ]'
     Assemble instructions to the specified address.  If only one
     instruction is specified, enter assembly mode (enter an empty line
     to exit assembly mode).

`d [<address> [<address>]]'
     Disassemble instructions.  If two addresses are specified, they
     are used as a start and end address.  If only one is specified, it
     is treated as the start address and a default number of
     instructions are disassembled.  If no addresses are specified, a
     default number of instructions are disassembled from the dot
     address.


File: vice.info,  Node: Checkpoint commands,  Next: General commands,  Prev: Assembly commands,  Up: Monitor

Checkpoint commands
===================

`break [<address> [if <cond_expr>] ]'
     This command allows setting a breakpoint or listing the current
     breakpoints.  If no address is given, the currently valid
     checkpoints are printed.  If an address is given, a breakpoint is
     set for that address and the breakpoint number is printed.  A
     conditional expression can also be specified for the breakpoint.
     For more information on conditions, see the CONDITION command.

`enable <checknum>'

`disable <checknum>'
     Each checkpoint can be enabled or disabled.  This command allows
     changing between these states.

`command <checknum> "<command>"'
     When checkpoint `checknum' is hit, the specified command is
     executed by the monitor.  Note that the `x' command is not yet
     supported as a command argument.

`condition <checknum> if <cond_expr>'
     Each time the specified checkpoint is examined, the condition is
     evaluated.  If it evalutes to true, the checkpoint is activated.
     Otherwise, it is ignores.  If registers are specified in the
     expression, the values used are those at the time the checkpoint
     is examined, not when the condition is set.

`delete <checknum>'
     Delete the specified checkpoint.

`ignore <checknum> [<count>]'
     Ignore a checkpoint a given number of crossings.  If no count is
     given, the default value is 1.

`trace [address [address]]'
     This command is similar to the `break' command except that it
     operates on tracepoints.  A tracepoint differs from a breakpoint
     by not stopping execution but simply printing the PC, giving the
     user an execution trace.  The second optional address can be used
     to specify the end of an range of addresses to be traced.

`watch [address [address]]'
     This command is similar to the previous two commands except that it
     operates on watchpoints.  A watchpoint differs from the others by
     stopping on a read and/or write to an address or range of
     addresses.  If no addresses are given, a list of all the
     watchpoints is printed.


File: vice.info,  Node: General commands,  Next: Disk commands,  Prev: Checkpoint commands,  Up: Monitor

General commands
================

`cd <directory>'
     Change the working directory.

`device [c:|d:]'
     Set the default memory device to either the computer (`c:') or the
     disk (`d:').

`radix [H|D|O|B]'
     Set the default radix to hex, decimal, octal, or binary.  With no
     argument, the current radix is printed.

`sidefx [on|off|toggle]'
     Control how monitor generated reads affect memory locations that
     have read side-effects.  If the argument is 'on' then reads may
     cause side-effects.  If the argument is 'off' then reads don't
     cause side-effects.  If the argument is 'toggle' then the current
     mode is switched.  No argument displays the current state.

`system <system command>'
     Nothing yet.


File: vice.info,  Node: Disk commands,  Next: Command file commands,  Prev: General commands,  Up: Monitor

Disk commands
=============

`br <track> <sector> [<address>]'
     Read the block at the specified track and sector.  If an address is
     specified, the data is loaded into memory.  If no address is
     given, the data is displayed using the default datatype.

`bw <track> <sector> <address>'
     Write a block of data at `address' to the specified track and
     sector of disk in drive 8.

`@<disk command>'
     Perform a disk command on the currently attached disk image on
     drive 8.  The specified disk command is sent to the drive's
     channel #15.

`load "<filename>" <address>'
     Load the specified file into memory at the specified address.

`save "<filename>" <address1> <address2>'
     Save the memory from address1 to address2 to the specified file.

Command file commands
=====================

`playback "<filename>"'
     Monitor commands from the specified file are read and executed.
     This command stops at the end of file or when a STOP command is
     read.

`record "<filename>"'
     After this command, all commands entered are written to the
     specified file until the STOP command is entered.

`stop'
     Stop recording commands.  See `record'.


File: vice.info,  Node: Label commands,  Next: Miscellaneous commands,  Prev: Command file commands,  Up: Monitor

Label commands
==============

`add_label <address> <label>'
     Map a given address to a label.  This label can be used when
     entering assembly code and is shown during disassembly.

`delete_label [<memspace>] <label>'
     Remove the specified label from the label tables.  If no memory
     space is checked, all tables are checked.

`load_labels [<memspace>] "<filename>"'
     Load a file containing a mapping of labels to addresses.  If no
     memory space is specified, the default readspace is used.

`save_labels [<memspace>] "<filename>"'
     Save labels to a file.  If no memory space is specified, all of the
     labels are saved.

`show_labels [<memspace>]'

c1541
*****

   VICE is provided with a complete stand-alone disk image maintenance
utility, called `c1541'.  You can either invoke it from the command
line or from within one of the VICE emulators, using the "Run c1541"
command which will open a new `xterm' window with a running `c1541' in
it.

   The syntax is:

     c1541 OPTIONS IMAGE

   If some `OPTIONS' but no `IMAGE' are specified, `c1541' runs in
batch mode; otherwise, it attaches the `IMAGE' if present and enters
interactive mode, where you can type commands that are executed when
you press Enter (abbreviations are allowed).  As with the monitor, file
name completion and command line editing with history are provided via
GNU `readline'.  Use the command `quit' to exit.

   Notice that `c1541' always creates `X64' files, but can read and
write `D64' and `T64' files automatically, without the need for any
special options.

Acknowledgments
***************

   VICE derives from X64, the first Commodore 64 emulator for the X
Window System.  Here is an informal list of the people who were mostly
involved in the development of X64 and VICE:

   The VICE core team:

   * Ettore Perazzoli (<ettore@comm2000.it>) made the 6510, VIC-II,
     VIC-I and CRTC emulations, part of the hardware-level 1541
     emulation, speed optimizations, bug fixes, the event-driven
     cycle-exact engine, the Xt/Xaw/Xfwf-based GUI for X11, a general
     code reorganization, the new resource handling, most of the
     documentation and the MS-DOS port (well, somebody had to do it).

   * Teemu Rantanen (<tvr@cs.hut.fi>) implemented the SID emulation and
     the trap-based disk drive and serial bus implementation; added
     support for multiple display depths under X11.

   * Andr'e Fachat (<fachat@physik.tu-chemnitz.de>) wrote the PET and
     CBM-II emulators, the CIA and VIA emulation, the IEEE488
     interface, implemented the IEC serial bus in `xvic' and made tons
     of bug fixes.

   * Daniel Sladic (<sladic@eecg.toronto.edu>) started the work on
     hardware-level 1541 emulation and wrote the new monitor introduced
     with VICE 0.15.

   * Andreas Boose (<boose@linux.rz.fh-hannover.de>) gave lots of
     information and bug reports about the VIC-II, the 6510 and the
     CIAs; moreover, he wrote several test-routines that were used to
     improve the emulation.  He also added cartridge support and has
     been the main head behind the drive emulation since version 0.15.

   * Dag Lem (<resid@nimrod.no>) implemented the reSID SID emulation
     engine.

   Former team members:

   * Jouko Valta (<jopi@stekt.oulu.fi>) wrote `petcat' and `c1541',
     `T64' handling, user service and maintenance (most of the work in
     x64 0.3.x was made by him); retired from the project in July 96,
     after VICE 0.10.0.

   * Jarkko Sonninen (<sonninen@lut.fi>) was the founder of the
     project, wrote the old version of the 6502 emulation and the
     XDebugger, and retired from the project after x64 0.2.1.

   External contributors:

   * Michael Schwendt (<sidplay@geocities.com>) helped with the SID
     (audio) chip emulation, bringing important suggestions and bug
     reports, as well as the wave tables and filter emulation from his
     SIDplay emulator.

   * Christian Bauer (<bauec002@goofy.zdv.uni-mainz.de>) wrote the very
     interesting "VIC article" from which we got invaluable information
     about the VIC-II chip: without this, the VIC-II implementation
     would have not been possible.

   * Wolfgang Lorenz wrote an excellent 6510 test suite that helped us
     to debug the CPU emulation.

   * Giuliano Procida (<gpp10@cam.ac.uk>) is the maintainer of the VICE
     `deb' package for the Debian distribution, and also helped
     proofreading the documentation.

   * Marko M"akel"a (<msmakela@nic.funet.fi>) wrote lots of CPU
     documentation.

   * Martin Pottendorfer (<Martin.Pottendorfer@aut.alcatel.at>)
     implemented the "Contents" button in the file selector and
     provided us with several suggestions and constant testing of
     constantly broken snapshots.

   * Chris Sharp (<sharpc@hurlsey.ibm.com>) wrote the AIX sound driver.

   * Krister Walfridsson (<cato@df.lth.se>) implemented joystick and
     sound support for NetBSD.

   * Mattias Engdeg^ard (<f91-men@nada.kth.se>) got non-default depths
     to work.

   * Peter Andrew Felvegi aka Petschy (<petschy@derceto.sch.bme.hu>)
     fixed a couple of bugs in the fast serial emulation.

   * Olaf Seibert (<rhialto@polder.ubc.kun.nl>) contributed some PET,
     and disk drive patches.

   * Daniel Fandrich (<dan@fch.wimsey.bc.ca>) contributed some disk
     drive patches.

   * Heiko Selber (<selber@fhi-berlin.mpg.de>) contributed some VIC20
     I/O patches.

   * Steven Tieu (<stieu@physics.ubc.ca>) added initial support for
     16/24 bpp X11 displays.

   * Alexander Lehmann (<alex@mathematik.th-darmstadt.de>) added
     complete support for all the VIC20 memory configurations for the
     old VICE 0.12.

   * Lionel Ulmer implemented joystick support for Linux and a first
     try of a SID emulation for SGI machines.

   * Bernhard Kuhn (<kuhn@eikon.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de>) made some
     joystick improvements for Linux.

   * Gerhard Wesp (<gwesp@cosy.sbg.ac.at>) contributed the `extract'
     command in `c1541'.

   * Ricardo Ferreira (<storm@esoterica.pt>) contributed the `unlynx'
     and `system' commands in `c1541'.

   * Tomi Ollila (<Tomi.Ollila@tfi.net>) donated `findpath.c'.

   * Richard Hable (<hab@fim.uni-linz.ac.at>) contributed the initial
     version of the REU Emulation.

   * Vesa-Matti Puro (<vmp@lut.fi>) wrote the very first 6502 CPU
     emulator in x64 0.1.0.  That was the beginning of the story...

   * Dan Miner (<dminer@nyx10.cs.du.edu>) contributed some patches to
     the fast disk drive emulation.

   * Frank Prindle (<Frank.Prindle@lambada.oit.unc.edu>) contributed
     some patches.

   * Peter Weighill (<stuce@csv.warwick.ac.uk>) gave many ideas and
     contributed the ROM patcher.

   * Dominique Strigl (<strigl@sxb.bsf.alcatel.fr>), Craig Jackson
     (<Craig.Jackson@lambada.oit.unc.edu>) and Lasse Jyrkinen
     ((<Lasse.Jyrkinen@uz.kuleuven.ac.be>) contributed miscellaneous
     patches in the old X64 times.

   * Per Olofsson (<MagerValp@Goth.Org>) digitalized the C64 colors
     used in the default palette.

   * Paul David Doherty (<h0142kdd@rz.hu-berlin.de>) wrote `zip2disk',
     on which the Zipcode support in `c1541' is based.

   * Robert H. Forsman Jr., Brian Totty (<totty@cs.uiuc.edu>) and
     Robert W. McMullen (<rwmcm@orion.ae.utexas.edu>) provided the
     widget set for implementing the `Xaw' GUI.

   * Shawn Hargreaves (<shawn@talula.demon.co.uk>) wrote Allegro, the
     graphics and audio library used in the MS-DOS version.

   (We hope we have not forgotten anybody; if you think we have, please
tell us.)

   Thanks also to everyone else for sending suggestions, ideas, bug
reports, questions and requests.  In particular, a warm thank goes to
the following people:

   * Lutz Sammer

   * Ralph Mason (<RALPHM@msmail02.liffe.com>)
