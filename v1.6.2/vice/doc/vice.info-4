Snapshots
*********

   Every VICE emulator has a built-in snapshot feature, that saves the
complete emulator state into one file for later use.  You can therefore
save the emulator state - including the state of the game you are
playing for example - in a single file.

Snapshot usage
==============

   A snapshot is one file containining the complete emulator state.  A
snapshot file can be generated by selecting the "Save snapshot" command
at any time.  This will pop up a requester from which you can specify
whether the snapshot should also contain the disk and ROM status.

   A snapshot file can be used to restore the emulator state by
selecting the `load snapshot' menu entry at any time.  Unfortunately
attached ROM images/cartridges are only supported in the VIC20, the PET
and the CBM-II emulators at this time.

   The memory configuration of the emulator is saved in the snapshot
file as well. This configuration is restored when the snapshot is
loaded.

   A quick snapshot can now be made by pressing the `M-F11' key and
reloaded by pressing the `M-F10' key.


File: vice.info,  Node: Snapshot format,  Prev: Snapshot usage,  Up: Snapshots

Snapshot format
===============

   A snapshot file consists of several modules of mostly different
types.  Each module has a name and saves the state of an entity like a
CIA, the CPU, or the memory.

Module formats
--------------

   This section shows the basic module framework and the contents of the
different types of modules.

   The single chip modules contain the chip state, not the state of the
emulator.  We tried to make the format as implementation-independent as
possible, to allow reuse of snapshots in later versions of this
emulator, or even in other emulators.

Terminology
...........

   In this section we use certain abbreviations to define the types of
the data saved in the snapshot.

`BYTE'
     8 bit integer.

`WORD'
     16 bit integer.  Saved with low-byte first, high-byte last.

`DWORD'
     32 bit integer.  Saved with low-word first, then high-word.  Each
     word saved with its low-byte first.

`ARRAY'
     Array of BYTE values.  Length depends on the description.

   The tables for the single modules state the type, name and
description of the data saved in the modules.  The data is saved in the
order it is in the tables, so no offset is given.

Module framework
................

   The VICE snapshot file starts with the magic string and includes the
fileformat version number.

Type    Name                          Description                          
19 BYTE MAGIC                         "VICE Snapshot File\032", padded     
                                      with 0                               
BYTE    VMAJOR                        fileformat major version number      
BYTE    VMINOR                        fileformat minor version number      
16 BYTE MACHINENAME                   Name of emulated machine, like       
                                      "PET", "CBM-II", "VIC20", "C64" or   
                                      "C128". zerobyte-padded.             

   The file header is followed by a number of different snapshot
modules.

   Each module has a header with the information given in the table
below.  The header includes two version numbers, VMAJOR and VMINOR.
Modules with the same VMAJOR should be able to be exchanged.  I.e.
higher VMINOR numbers only append to the data for lower VMINOR.  This
additional data is ignored by older restore routines.  The other way
around newer restore routines must accept the fewer info from lower
VMINOR dumps.  Changes in VMAJOR might introduce any incompatibility
you like, but that's what VMAJOR is for after all :-)

Type    Name                          Description                          
16 BYTE MODULENAME                    The name of the module in ASCII,     
                                      padded with 0 to 16 byte.            
BYTE    VMAJOR                        major version number                 
BYTE    VMINOR                        minor version number                 
DWORD   SIZE                          size of the module, not including    
                                      this header

   This module saves the core 6502 state.  You will find a clock value
there.  All other modules save their own clock values relative to this
value.  However, the drive modules save their clocks relative to their
appropriate CPUs of course.

   Warning: This module is still under construction and saves some
information that is not sure to be VICE-independent.  If in doubt, read
the source.

   The last two items have been added in CIA snapshot version 1.1 due
to the improved CIA emulation in the newer VICE versions.  Some state
bits correspond to the CIA state as described in the "A Software Model

versions. For more read the source file `ciatimer.h'.

ACIA module

   The ACIA 6551 is an RS232 interface chip.  VICE emulates RS232
connections via `/dev/ttyS*' (Unix) or `COM:' (DOS/WIN - not yet?).
When saving a snapshot, those connections are of course lost.  The
state of the ACIA however is restored if possible.  I.e. if a connection
is already open when restoring the snapshot, this connection is used
instead.  If no connection is open, a carrier/DTR drop is emulated.

CRTC module
...........

   Warning: After VICE version 1.0 the CRTC emulation has improved
considerably. Especially it is now cycle exact. Therefore a lot more
variables must be saved. The snapshot module version jumped from 0.0 to
1.0. Newer versions of VICE can read the old snapshots, but older
versions (1.0 and below) cannot read the new snapshots.

   Warning: This module is still under construction.  Especially the
RASTERY and RASTERLINE values might be bogus.

   Version numbers: Major 1, Minor 0.

C64 memory module
.................

   The C64 memory module actually consists of two modules.  The
"C128MEM" module is mandatory and contains the RAM dump.  The "C64ROM"
module is optional and contains a dump of the ROM images.

   The size of the C64 memory modules differs with each different memory
configuration. The RAM configuration is saved in the snapshot, and
restored when the snapshot is loaded. The attached cartridges are not
yet(!) saved and not yet restored upon load.

PET memory module
.................

   The PET memory module actually consists of two modules.  The
"PETMEM" module is mandatory and contains the RAM dump.  The "PETROM"
module is optional and contains a dump of the ROM images.

   The size of the PET memory modules differs with each different memory
configuration.  The RAM configuration is saved in the snapshot, and
restored when the snapshot is loaded.

                                      screen, bit 0=1 = EOI blanks screen. 

   The last item has been added in PETMEM snapshot version 1.1. It is
ignored by earlier restore routines (V1.0) and the V1.1 restore routines
do not change the current setting when reading a V1.0 snapshot.

   In V1.2 the new EOIBLANK variable has been added. This implements
the "blank screen on EOI" feature that was previously linked to a wrong
resource.
