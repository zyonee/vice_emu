Missing features
- Drag'n'Drop support
- Session Management

Known Bugs (help is appreciated !):
- x128 gives a GTK warning because topmenu is reused. However this seems not
  to be a problem.
- Gnome commandline is ignored.
- Get font from X Resource database for textwindows/CBM font preview windows.

Things, which will change (don't ask when!):
- Tape status widget (.TAP vs .t64) handling is lousy.
- Monitor GUI
- VIC20 Cartridge attach heuristic for image pairs
- More standard Gnome'ish menus.

Gnome 1
Some state-of-the-art Unix/Linux distributions don't support
Gnome1/Gtk1 application development as some packages are not installed
by default. Sometimes those packages are shipped. E.g. for Fedora Core
4 the user has to install the following packages:
  
  glib-devel-1.2.10-16.i386.rpm
  ORBit-devel-0.5.17-15.i386.rpm
  gtk+-devel-1.2.10-39.i386.rpm
  imlib-devel-1.9.13-24.i386.rpm
  gnome-libs-devel-1.4.1.2.90-46.i386.rpm

To compile the gnome1/gtk1 version use configure option
`--enable-gnomeui'.

Vice-1.19 will be the last officially supported Gnome1/Gtk1 version.

Gnome 2
A separate patch for Gnome 2 support is available (see website).
The port is fully functional. Only the CBM font in the content preview
widget and within the context menu is not working yet.
Credits to Andrew Burton for a few inspiring lines of code donated
about 2 years ago. ;^)

To compile this version you need to have certain gnome2/gtk2 devel
packages installed. Further automake and autoconf is needed.

To compile do something similar than this:
> cd <...>/vice-1.19
> zcat <...>/vice-1.19-gnome2.diff.gz |patch -p1
> autoconf
> ./configure --enable-gnomeui ... <other options> ...
> # cross fingers and hope...
> make
> make install

The port is known to work pretty well on Linux Fedora Core 4.
