<H1><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC15">3  Invoking the emulators</A></H1>

<P>
The names of the available emulators are:

</P>

<P> <UL>

<P> <LI>

<CODE>x64</CODE>, the C64 emulator

<P> <LI>

<CODE>x128</CODE>, the C128 emulator

<P> <LI>

<CODE>xpet</CODE>, the PET emulator

<P> <LI>

<CODE>xvic</CODE>, the VIC20 emulator

</UL> </P>

<P>
You can run each of them by simply typing the name from a shell.  If you
want to run them from another application (e.g. a window manager or some
other sort of program launcher) you should always run them from a
terminal window such as <CODE>xterm</CODE> or <CODE>rxvt</CODE>, as a lot of
debugging information is printed and the built-in monitor will be run in
there.  For example, you could do

</P>

<PRE>
xterm -e ./x64 -dir ../../data/C64
</PRE>

<P>
There are several options you can specify on the command line, and the
<CODE>-help</CODE> option lists all of them all.

</P>
<P>
It is possible to let the emulator <EM>autostart</EM> a disk or tape image
file, by simply specifying its name as the last argument on the command
line; for example

</P>

<PRE>
x64 lovelygame.x64.gz
</PRE>

<P>
will start the C64 emulator, attaching <TT>`lovelygame.x64.gz'</TT> as a
disk image and running the first program on it.  You can also specify
the name of the program on the fisk image by appending a colon
(<SAMP>`:'</SAMP>) the name itself to the argument; for example

</P>

<PRE>
x64 "lovelygame.x64.gz:run me"
</PRE>

<P>
will run the program named <TT>`run me'</TT> on <TT>`lovelygame.x64.gz'</TT>
instead of the first one.

</P>
<P>
See section <A HREF="vice_5.html#SEC25">5.5  Using disk and tape images</A> for more information about images and
autostart.
