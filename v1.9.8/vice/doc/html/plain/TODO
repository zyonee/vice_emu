What are we going to do next (or not)
=====================================

* General improvements
----------------------

- Write real MS-DOS and Win32 documentation (any volunteers?).

- Allow tape loading without the virtually pressed "Play" button,
  which can break some programs that do not like it to be pressed
  (e.g. Turbo Assembler).

- Emulate shifted keys more accurately by delaying the shifted key
  after the shift.

- Emulate the RESTORE key more accurately.

- Some more Kernal patches, for instance for changing colors and
  patching the reset routine to make it faster (maybe configurable).

- Filtering video output to make it look more like an old monitor or
  a TV set. This is work in progress. As of 1.8 there is a fast PAL
  emulation.

- More ports.  Any volunteers?  A BEOS port is in the works; if you
  want to help, please let us know.

* C128 improvements
-------------------

- Support missing keys (Caps Lock).

* VIC20 improvements
--------------------

- Improve the accuracy of the audio emulation.

* PET improvements
------------------

- Reimplement the CRTC caching functionality

* CBM-II improvements
------------------

- Reimplement the CRTC caching functionality

* Plus/4
--------

- Implement a Plus/4 emulator (already started, but not ready for
  prime time).

* Drive improvements
--------------------

- Implement CBM DOS 1.0 support (670 blocks free) together with CBM 2040
  disk drive emulation.
