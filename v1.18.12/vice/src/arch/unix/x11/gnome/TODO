Missing features
- Drag'n'Drop support
- Session Management

Known Bugs (help is appreciated !):
- x128 gives a GTK warning because topmenu is reused. However this seems not
  to be a problem.
- Gnome commandline is ignored.
- Get font from X Resource database for textwindows/CBM font preview windows.

Things, which will change (don't ask when!):
- Tape status widget (.TAP vs .t64) handling is lousy.
- Monitor GUI
- VIC20 Cartridge attach heuristic for image pairs
- More standard Gnome'ish menus.

Gnome 1
Some state-of-the-art Unix/Linux distributions don't support
Gnome1/Gtk1 application development as some packages are not installed
by default. Sometimes those packages are shipped. E.g. for Fedora Core
4 the user has to install the following packages:
  
  glib-devel-1.2.10-16.i386.rpm
  ORBit-devel-0.5.17-15.i386.rpm
  gtk+-devel-1.2.10-39.i386.rpm
  imlib-devel-1.9.13-24.i386.rpm
  gnome-libs-devel-1.4.1.2.90-46.i386.rpm

Vice-1.19 will be the last officially supported Gnome1/Gtk1 version.

Gnome 2
A separate patch for Gnome 2 support is available (see website).
The port is fully functional. Only the CBM font in the content preview
widget and context menu is not working yet.
