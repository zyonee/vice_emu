/* FIXME: This does not fully save/restore the chip state; e.g. the current
   character line and the current value of the memory pointer are not taken
   into account.  This means that the first frame after the restore will be
   wrong, but things will be fine in the next frame.  This is not a real
   problem for the CRTC, as these data are not timing-sensitive as on the
   VIC-II, but some day we will have to fix it.  For now, it is even better
   to leave as it is because we are not accurately modeling the CRTC chip and
   the behavior of the raster, so the data we would write would only be
   bogus.  */
