Missing features
- Internationalization
- Drag'n'Drop support
- Session Management

Known Bugs (help is appreciated !):
- x128 gives a GTK warning because topmenu is reused. However this seems not
  to be a problem.
- Gnome commandline is ignored.
- Get font from X Resource database for textwindows/CBM font preview windows.
- Setting the color palette twice leads to GTK/X error assertion
  on 8bit colordepth Xservers. Help is appreciated.
  Xservers with colordepth >=16bit don't show the problem. 
- Memory corruption has been observed in late 1.2.xx snapshots (never
  released to the public). Unfortunately those problems aren't
  reproducable now (vice-1.3.3), so if you have access to a memcheck
  tool (purify, etc.), have time and nothing else to do, you could
  give it a try! Feedback here is welcome!

Things, which will change (don't ask when!):
- Tape status widget (.TAP vs .t64) handling is lousy.
- Monitor GUI
- VIC20 Cartridge attach heuristic for image pairs
- More standard Gnome'ish toplevel menus.

Postponed
- Fullscreen support
