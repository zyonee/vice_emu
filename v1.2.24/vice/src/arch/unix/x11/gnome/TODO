# This is a list for me to gather already identified problems. It's not 
# systematic and probably not complete!

Missing features
- Implement remaining dummy (fullscreen support is missing,).
- Implement 2 color LEDs
- Internationalization
- Session Management

Known Bugs (help is appreciated !):
- Hotkey event doesn't eat key 
  e.g. ALT-w enables warp but `w' is also passed on
- Currently events aren't blocked for the main window, when a popup window
  is open (-> one can open multiple file dialogs, which leads to confusion
  of the uicode).
- x128 shows topmenu only on VDC window and gives a GTK warning.
- vsid mode doesn't work properly. Dag takes care of this.

Things, which will change:
- Contents preview will go inside the file selector (as in win32 version).
