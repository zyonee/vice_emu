Urgent things to do!
====================

These things must definitely be done /before/ ever thinking about a
release:

- support watchpoints on all the models;

- support autostart and keyboard buffer handling on the PET;

- complete the MS-DOS port;

- check the SID drivers (Sun/Linux are known to work, the other ones
  should be tested);


What are we going to do next
============================

* General improvements
----------------------

  - More ports!  (E.g. MacOS, Win32, BeOS...)  Any volunteers?

  - Snapshot format to freeze the emulators' state.  The main issue is
    to make it as implementation-independent as possible, so that
    snapshots made with the current versions will still run on the
    future ones.

  - Convert all the documentation to texinfo, so that it can be
    translated to different formats more easily.

  - Write real MS-DOS documentation (any volunteers?).

  - Allow tape loading without the virtually pressed "Play" button,
    which can break some programs that do not like this.

  - Emulate shifted keys more accurately by delaying the shifted key
    after the shift.

  - Emulate the RESTORE key more accurately.

  - Better support for alternative ROM sets.

  - Some more kernal patches, for instance for changing colors and
    patching the reset routine to make it faster (maybe configurable)?

* C64 improvements
------------------

  - Faster and (maybe) cycle-exact SID (the current version is
    sample-accurate).

  - Better handling for REU load/save.  It would be nice to have a few
    menu entries to do this.

  - More accurate REU emulation, with 16 Mbyte mode.

  - 1351 mouse emulation, at least on MS-DOS.

* VIC20 improvements
--------------------

  - Better, possibly cycle-based, emulation of the VIC-I chip.

  - Improve the accuracy of the audio emulation.

  - Tape support.

* PET improvements
------------------

  - Complete CRTC emulation.

  - Support for different models at runtime.

  - Better sound emulation.

  - Tape support.

  - Autostart does not work (yet)!

* 1541 improvements
-------------------

  - Emulate more than just one 1541 drive with the "true" emulation.
