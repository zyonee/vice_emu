<H1><A NAME="SEC96" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC96">8  Monitor</A></H1>

<P>
Every VICE emulator has a complete built-in monitor, which can be used
to examine, disassemble and assemble machine language programs, as well
as debug them through breakpoints.  It can be activated by using the
"Activate monitor" command (left button menu).  Notice that you have
to run the emulator from a terminal emulation program (such as
<CODE>rxvt</CODE> or <CODE>xterm</CODE>) in order to use the monitor.

</P>
<P>
<B>Warning</B>: this version of the monitor is still under construction,
and some of the features are not fully working yet.

<H2><A NAME="SEC97" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC97">8.1  Terminology</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<P><DT><SAMP>`address_space'</SAMP>
<DD>
This refers to the range of memory locations and a set of registers.
This can be the addresses available to the computer's processor, the
disk drive's processor or a specific memory configuration of one of the
mentioned processors.

<P><DT><SAMP>`register'</SAMP>
<DD>
One of the following: program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP),
accumulator (A), X register (X), or Y register (Y).

<P><DT><SAMP>`address'</SAMP>
<DD>
A specific memory location in the range $0000 to $FFFF.

<P><DT><SAMP>`address_range'</SAMP>
<DD>
Two addresses.  If the second address is less than the first, the range
is assumed to wraparound from $FFFF to $0000.  Both addresses must be in
the same address space.

<P><DT><SAMP>`address_opt_range'</SAMP>
<DD>
An address or an address range.

<P><DT><SAMP>`prompt'</SAMP>
<DD>
The prompt has the format [x:y].  If x is -, memory reads from the
monitor do not have side effects.  Otherwise, x is S.  The second part of
the prompt, y, shows the default address space.

<P><DT><SAMP>`checkpoint'</SAMP>
<DD>
The monitor has the ability to setup triggers that perform an action
when a specified situation occurs.  There are three types of checkpoints;
breakpoints, tracepoints and watchpoints.

<P><DT><SAMP>`breakpoint'</SAMP>
<DD>
A breakpoint is triggered based on the program counter.  When it is
triggered, the monitor is entered.

<P><DT><SAMP>`tracepoint'</SAMP>
<DD>
Like breakpoints, a tracepoint is triggered based on the program
counter.  Instead of entering the monitor, the program counter is
printed and execution continues.

<P><DT><SAMP>`watchpoint'</SAMP>
<DD>
Watchpoints are triggered by a read and/or write to an address.  When a
watchpoint is triggered, the monitor is entered.

<P><DT><SAMP>`&#60;...&#62;'</SAMP>
<DD>
A data type.

<P><DT><SAMP>`*'</SAMP>
<DD>
Zero or more occurrences.

<P><DT><SAMP>`[...]'</SAMP>
<DD>
An optional argument.

<H2><A NAME="SEC98" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC98">8.2  Machine state commands</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<P><DT><CODE>goto &#60;address&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Change the PC to address and continue execution.

<DD>
Nothing yet.  Will display VIC/VIA/CIA/SID registers.

<P><DT><CODE>next [&#60;count&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
Advance to the next instruction.  Subroutines are treated as
a single instruction.

<P><DT><CODE>registers [&#60;reg_name&#62; = &#60;number&#62; [, &#60;reg_name&#62; = &#60;number&#62;]*]</CODE>

This command allows displaying and setting the registers of the 6502
microprocessor.  Valid register names are A, X, Y, PC and SP.

<P><DT><CODE>return</CODE>
<DD>
Continues the execution of the 6502 and returns to the monitor just
before(after?) the next RTS or RTI is executed.

<P><DT><CODE>step [&#60;count&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
Single step through instructions.  An optional count allows stepping more
than a single instruction at a time.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC99" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC99">8.3  Memory commands</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<P><DT><CODE>compare &#60;address_range&#62; &#60;address&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Compare memory from the source specified by the address range to the
destination specified by the address.  The regions may overlap.  Any
values that miscompare are displayed using the default displaytype.

<P><DT><CODE>fill &#60;address_range&#62; &#60;data_list&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Fill memory in the specified address range with the data in
&#60;data_list&#62;.  If the size of the address range is greater than the size
of the data_list, the data_list is repeated.

<P><DT><CODE>hunt &#60;address_range&#62; &#60;data_list&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Hunt memory in the specified address range for the data in
&#60;data_list&#62;.  If the data is found, the starting address of the match is
displayed.  The entire range is searched for all possible matches.

<P><DT><CODE>i &#60;address_opt_range&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Display memory contents as PETSCII text.

<P><DT><CODE>m [data_type] [address_opt_range]</CODE>
<DD>
Display the contents of memory.  If no datatype is given, the default is
used.  If only one address is specified, the length of data displayed is
based on the datatype.  If no addresses are given, the 'dot' address is
used.

<P><DT><CODE>mc [data_type] [address_opt_range]</CODE>
<DD>
Display the contents of memory as character data.  If only one address
is specified, only one character is displayed.  If no addresses are
given, the "dot" address is used.

<P><DT><CODE>ms [data_type] [address_opt_range]</CODE>
<DD>
Display the contents of memory as sprite data.  If only one address is
specified, only one sprite is displayed.  If no addresses are given, the
"dot" address is used.

<P><DT><CODE>move address_range address</CODE>
<DD>
<P><DT><CODE>transfer address_range address</CODE>
<DD>
Move memory from the source specified by the address range to
the destination specified by the address.  The regions may overlap.

<P><DT><CODE>&#62; [address] &#60;data_list&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Display the specified number in decimal, hex, octal and binary.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC100" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC100">8.4  Assembly commands</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<P><DT><CODE>a &#60;address&#62; [ &#60;instruction&#62; [: &#60;instruction&#62;]* ]</CODE>
<DD>
Assemble instructions to the specified address.  If more than one
instruction is given, the command does not cause the monitor to enter
assembly mode.

<P><DT><CODE>d [&#60;address&#62; [&#60;address&#62;]]</CODE>
<DD>
Disassemble instructions.  If two addresses are specified, they are used
as a start and end address.  If only one is specified, it is treated as
the start address and a default number of instructions are
disassembled.  If no addresses are specified, a default number of
instructions are disassembled from the dot address.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC101" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC101">8.5  Checkpoint commands</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<P><DT><CODE>break [&#60;address&#62; [if &#60;cond_expr&#62;] ]</CODE>
<DD>
This command allows setting a breakpoint or listing the current
breakpoints.  If no address is given, the currently valid checkpoints
are printed.  If an address is given, a breakpoint is set for that
address and the breakpoint number is printed.  A conditional expression
can also be specified for the breakpoint.  For more information on
conditions, see the CONDITION command.

<P><DT><CODE>enable/disable &#60;checknum&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Each checkpoint can be enabled or disabled.  This command allows changing
between these states.

<P><DT><CODE>command &#60;check_num&#62; "&#60;command&#62;"</CODE>
<DD>
When checkpoint check_num is hit, the specified command is executed by
the monitor.  Note that the 'x' command is not yet supported as a
command argument.

<P><DT><CODE>condition &#60;checknum&#62; if &#60;cond_expr&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Each time the specified checkpoint is examined, the condition is
evaluated.  If it evalutes to true, the checkpoint is activated.
Otherwise, it is ignores.  If registers are specified in the expression,
the values used are those at the time the checkpoint is examined, not
when the condition is set.

<P><DT><CODE>delete &#60;check_num&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Delete the specified checkpoint.

<P><DT><CODE>ignore &#60;checknum&#62; [&#60;count&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
Ignore a checkpoint a given number of crossings.  If no count is given,
the default value is 1.

<P><DT><CODE>trace [address [address]]</CODE>
<DD>
This command is similar to the <CODE>break</CODE> command except that it
operates on tracepoints.  A tracepoint differs from a breakpoint by not
stopping execution but simply printing the PC, giving the user an
execution trace.  The second optional address can be used to specify the
end of an range of addresses to be traced.

<P><DT><CODE>watch [address [address]]</CODE>
<DD>
This command is similar to the previous two commands except that it
operates on watchpoints.  A watchpoint differs from the others by
stopping on a read and/or write to an address or range of addresses.  If
no addresses are given, a list of all the checkpoints is printed.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC102" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC102">8.6  General commands</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<P><DT><CODE>cd &#60;directory&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Change the working directory.

<P><DT><CODE>device [c:|d:]</CODE>
<DD>
Set the default memory device to either the computer or the disk.

<P><DT><CODE>radix [H|D|O|B]</CODE>
<DD>
Set the default radix to hex, decimal, octal, or binary.  With no
argument, the current radix is printed.

<P><DT><CODE>sidefx [on|off|toggle]</CODE>
<DD>
Control how monitor generated reads affect memory locations that have
read side-effects.  If the argument is 'on' then reads may cause
side-effects.  If the argument is 'off' then reads don't cause
side-effects.  If the argument is 'toggle' then the current mode is
switched.  No argument displays the current state.  (Unfinished!)

<P><DT><CODE>system &#60;system command&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Nothing yet.

</DL>

specified, the data is loaded into memory.  If no address is given, the
data is displayed on the screen using the default datatype.

<P><DT><CODE>bw &#60;track&#62; &#60;sector&#62; &#60;address&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
This command writes a block of data at address to the specified track

<DL COMPACT>

<P><DT><CODE>playback "&#60;filename&#62;"</CODE>
<DD>
Monitor commands from the specified file are read and executed.  This
command stops at the end of file or when a STOP command is read.

<P><DT><CODE>record "&#60;filename&#62;"</CODE>

assembly code and is shown during disassembly.

<P><DT><CODE>delete_label [&#60;memspace&#62;] &#60;label&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Remove the specified label from the label tables.  If no memory space is
checked, all tables are checked.

<P><DT><CODE>load_labels [&#60;memspace&#62;] "&#60;filename&#62;"</CODE>
<DD>
Load a file containing a mapping of labels to addresses.  If no memory
space is specified, the default readspace is used.

<P><DT><CODE>save_labels [&#60;memspace&#62;] "&#60;filename&#62;"</CODE>
<DD>
Save labels to a file.  If no memory space is specified, all of the
labels are saved.
