  consecutive underflows happen.

- Cartridge support has been added.

- "4064" and "SX" are now valid ROM patch IDs (the same as "100" and
  "67" respectively).

** C128 changes
---------------

- YES!  The one and only free C128 emulator (x128) is back into
  operation!  No VDC, though.  No, don't ask us to implement it
  because we are not going to.  But of course contributions are
  (still) welcome.

** VIC20 changes
----------------

- The VIA emulation is now cycle-exact.

- Autostart is now implemented and works as in the C64 emulator.

** Monitor changes
------------------

- The old monitor has been replaced by a completely new one, written
  by Daniel Sladic.  Although it is still under construction, it also
  allows access to the CPU in the 1541 drive, and features watchpoints
  and breakpoints.

** Unix changes
---------------

- Sound and joystick is now supported on NetBSD too (courtesy of
  Krister Walfridsson <cato@df.lth.se>).

- Support for multiple keyboard layouts and joystick mappings has been
  added.  A "positional" layout for US keyboards is provided.  On the
  C64, VIC20 and C128 emulators, Ctrl is now mapped to Tab; the
  Commodore key is now mapped to left Ctrl.

- The emulators and c1541 now use the real, full-featured GNU readline
  library if found.  Use `./configure --without-readline' for the old
  behavior.

- RS232 and printer support has been added.

- The XDebugger has died (R.I.P.).

** MS-DOS changes
-----------------

- Support for two "hardware" joysticks has been added.

- The emulated drive LED has been moved to the CapsLock LED; the
  ScrollLock LED is turned on when "warp" (maximum speed) mode is
  enabled.

- The menu system has been made a bit more usable.  It is now possible
  to open a submenu directly from the emulator screen by pressing Alt
  and the corresponding hotkey.

- An Allegro-based sound driver has been implemented.  It replaces the
  old MIDAS driver in binary distributions because of licensing
  incompatibilities.

- The video driver can now use triple buffering for much smoother
  animations (don't use it under Windows).

- 1351 mouse emulation has been implemented.  Make sure a working
  mouse driver is installed.

- It is now possible to use up to two "real" joysticks and to
  configure the keyboard settings for both emulated joysticks.  As a
  result, it is now possible for two people to play together with two
  "real" joysticks or just with the keyboard.

- A bug that could corrupt the file descriptor table has been fixed.

- The file selector is now much faster when running under plain
  MS-DOS, as it uses `findfirst()'/`findnext()' instead of DJGPP's
  Unix-like `opendir()'/`stat()' calls.

** Miscellaneous changes
------------------------

- The file system can be accessed from any drive now, and complete
  support for P00 files has been implemented.

- A major cleanup of the code has been done (this is what took most of
  the time between 0.14.2 and 0.15.0).  Porting and adding features or
  emulators is now much easier.

- "On the fly" Lynx and Zipcode support has been added (use with care,
  though).

- A couple of bugs in the fast serial emulation have been fixed
  (courtesy of Peter Andrew Felvegi <petschy@derceto.sch.bme.hu>).

- Sound output can now be oversampled up to 8 times.

- The `TapeName' resource has been removed.

** PET changes
--------------

- Emulation of joysticks connected to the user port has been added.

** Unix changes
---------------

- The "change working directory" command displays the current working
  directory as default.

- A new status bar on the bottom of the emulation window displays the
  current speed and frame rate, and the status (i.e. LED + R/W head
  position) of the disk drive when the true 1541 emulation is turned
  on.

** MS-DOS changes
-----------------

- A bug that caused sprites to appear near the screen when the
  640x480 resolution was used has been fixed.

** Miscellaneous changes
------------------------

- A little timing error in the 6510 RMW instructions using absolute
  indexed addressing has been corrected.

- Much improved 1541 emulation: most custom write routines should now
  work.


* Changes in VICE 0.14.1
========================

** C64 changes
--------------

- A nasty CIA-related bug has been fixed.


* Changes in VICE 0.14.0
========================

** 6502/6510 changes
--------------------

- Several mostly timing-related 6510 bugs have been fixed (thanks to
  Andreas Boose's test suites).

** C64 changes
--------------

- Better SID (audio chip) emulation.  Now filters are emulated and
  waveforms are more accurate.  (Many thanks go to Michael Schwendt,
  author of SIDplay, for helping out with this and for providing the
  filter code and the SID wave tables.)

- Some CIA bugs have been fixed (big thanks to Andreas Boose for
  reporting them).

- The IEC bus recalculation has been made slightly faster (but you
  will probably not notice this, also because the true 1541
  compatibility improvements have made the emulation a bit slower).

- Some VIC-II bugs have been fixed (more big thanks to Andreas for his
  invaluable test suite).

- Disk/tape images can be "autostarted" from the command-line (with
  the new `-autostart' option) or at runtime (i.e. you can attach the
  image and let the emulator run and execute the first program on it
  for you).  This also works with `P00' and raw CBM binary files.

** VIC20 changes
----------------

- Fixed a small resizing-related bug.

** PET changes
--------------

- Improved/fixed keyboards on X11.

- New `PetModel', `VideoWidth' and `KeyboardType' resources.

- Added support for 2001, 4032B and 8096 PETs.

- Better CRTC emulation: R01 (line width) and R12 (control register)
  are honoured now.

** Unix changes
---------------

- Dispatching of Xt events fixed (there was a very stupid bug that
  caused event loops to do busy waits--argh!).

- Made WindowMaker-compliant (x64, xvic and xpet can now be docked).
  Now, could anybody please contribute cool NeXTish truecolor icons?
  :-)

- Better handling of window resizing.

- `configure' now uses Xaw3d only if `--with-xaw3d' is specified on
  the command line.

- The pop-up menus now work also if NumLock or CapsLock are activated.

- A private colormap is automatically used (even if `-install' has not
  been specified on the command line) if the emulator cannot allocate
  all the colors at startup.

- Increased portability: now compiles successfully on SunOS 4.x.

- Improved automatic frame skipping algorithm; it now gives a higher
  average frame rate.

- Different, possibly more usable, menu layout.

** MS-DOS changes
-----------------

- The contents of disk and tape images can be inspected before
  attaching them.

** Miscellaneous changes
------------------------

- The 1541 emulation is now more accurate (disk rotation is taken into
  account, but hardware formatting still does not work although we are
  not far from it).

- Safer handling for 1541 ROMs: a checksum is calculated, and turning
  full 1541 emulation on when no ROM is available does not make the
  emulator crash anymore.

- BZIP v2 support has been added (from Andreas Boose).

- Read-only support for various archiving formats (`.tar.gz', `.zip',
  `.lzh', `.zoo') has been added.

- The character ROMs are no longer built-in.

- Removed `.doc' extension from certain files in the documentation, as
  it confused HTML browsers.

- Useless Makefile target that caused problems with newer versions of
  GNU make removed.

- C1541 can now create disk images from Zipcoded files (`zcreate'),
  import Lynx archives (`unlynx') and execute DOS or UNIX commands
  (`system').  (`unlynx' and `system' have been contributed by Ricardo
  Ferreira.)

- Wrapping around $FFFF in monitor commands works now (beware: not for
  all of them, yet!).

- New, more usable, version of the `recomment' utility.

- Support for Simple DirectMedia Layer has been added.

- Character generator ROMs are not built-in anymore.


* Changes in VICE 0.13.0
========================

- Improved (now cycle-exact!) VIC-II emulation (big thanks go to
  Andreas Boose for helping me to improve it).

- More accurate 6510 emulation (emulates extra unused read accesses).

- Lower memory requirements.

- Complete MS-DOS port.

- Several CIA fixes.

- The VIC-I chip now emulates the reverse mode.

- Loading from tape handles the memory pointers correctly.

- Joystick emulation in the VIC20 emulator.

- Slightly better source code organization.


* Changes in VICE-0.12.1
========================

- The CIAs have been rewritten and are now more compatible and much
  faster (most of the games that ran much more slowly than usual with
  0.12.0 should now run at normal speed).

- VIC-II screen updates are now a little faster and also eat less
  memory.

- Disk images can now be attached in read-only mode.

- Gzip-compressed disk and tape images can be attached directly,
  without uncompressing them.

- The hardware-level 1541 emulation now supports writing to the disk
  through the VIAs, so that write patches to the drive ROM are not
  needed any longer. [please notice that this might not work with
  everything, as the emulation is not 100% exact]

- VICE can now be compiled also with the standard (0.8.0) joystick
  module (without digital joystick support, obviously).

- A little bug related to the right Shift key has been solved
  (courtesy of Bernhard Schwall).

- The numeric keypad can now be used to emulate diagonal directions
  too.

- The Linux audio driver also works on 8-bit sound cards.

- When a CPU jam happens (illegal opcode), the user can now choose
  between entering the monitor, enabling the XDebugger or resetting the
  machine.

- Implemented the new `skip' button in the XDebugger.

- Some little annoying bugs in the SID emulation have been fixed and
  combined pulse/sawtooth and pulse/triangle waveforms have been
  implemented.

- The automatic refresh rate setting works better when sound is
  enabled.

- The adaptive playback speed in the sound driver can now be disabled.

- Sound can now be turned off automatically when buffer overruns
  happen, and is automatically turned on again after a specified
  interval.

- AIX audio support has been implemented (courtesy of Chris Sharp
  (sharpc@hursley.ibm.com)).

- The sprite collision interrupts are more correctly triggered.

- A bad bug related to the sprite expansion register has been fixed.

- The video cache now handles sprite-background collisions correctly.

- A nasty bug that could cause VICE to hang has been fixed.

- Attaching floppy images to drive 9 or 10 no longer makes them appear
  in drive 8 when full 1541 emulation is enabled.

- Solved some problems with systems that do not have regexp.h (at
  least we hope so).

- GNU make is no longer needed to compile the PET and VIC20 emulators.

- The documentation has been updated.

- The `tounix' and `toiso' utilities have been added.

- The problem that made VICE die with an `alarm clock' signal on very
  slow or overloaded machines should now be gone.

- The file selector no longer dies if you type `~' with no `/' in the
  directory field.

- The file selector now has a "contents" button with which you can see
  the contents of a disk or tape image before attaching it.

- The X11 video driver automatically disables usage of the MITSHM
  extensions if they are not supported by the X11 server (even if the
  `mitshm' resource is non-zero).

- Some annoying REU-related bugs have been fixed.

- The MS-DOS version uses the Scroll Lock LED to emulate the drive LED.


* Changes in VICE-0.12.0
========================

Well, almost 90% of the emulation code has been rewritten (that's why
it took so long to have this release out), so it would be quite long
to list everything here.  Anyway, here are the most important new
features:

- New 6510 emulation, which is much faster and has (hopefully) correct
  memory fetch timings and exact emulation for all the opcodes.

- Completely rewritten video emulations, now much faster and more
  versatile: the window size can be doubled at run-time and the video
  cache can be disabled when not necessary.

- (Much) better VIC-II (C64 video chip) emulation, mostly rewritten
  from scratch: it can now handle most $D011 tricks such as VSP
  (Creatures and Mayhem in Monsterland work) and FLI; [yes, the silly
  sprite priority problems are gone]

- (Slightly) better VIC-I (VIC20 video chip) emulation (still
  incomplete).

- New SID emulator by Teemu Rantanen, with support for Linux, FreeBSD,
  Solaris and HP-UX (not all of these are stable, though).

- New CIA emulation with correct timing.

- Faster interrupt handling.

- Xaw-based GUI with popup menus and interactive file selector from
  the Free Widget Foundation.

- Hardware-based 1541 disk-drive emulation, that works with many
  custom loading routines.

- New resource handling that allows saving and loading of settings.

- MS-DOS port (no sound yet, UI almost non-existent).

- Better T64 handling (still buggy).

- Removed C128 emulator and RAM tester (sorry, we had no time to work
  at them).

- Much better Linux joystick support, that works with digital and
  analog joysticks with auto-calibration (courtesy of Bernhard Kuhn
  <kuhn@eikon.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de>); [it should compile out of the
  box now]

- Support for all possible VIC20 memory configurations on the command
  line (courtesy of Alexander Lehmann <alex@mathematik.th-darmstadt.de>).

- Added `extract' command to c1541 (courtesy of Gerhard Wesp
  <gwesp@cosy.sbg.ac.at>).

- Added configure script for easier configuration and installation.

- Overall better source code organization, that should make porting
  much easier; [volunteers, you are welcome!]

- Better keyboard handling (reverse polling is correct now).

- The REU works.

- Several other bugs fixes and improvements we have lost track of.


* Changes in VICE-0.11.0
========================

- The CPU in x64, xvic and xpet is now 2 times faster on average; :->

- The VIC-II steals the correct number of cycles for bad lines and
  sprites, and correctly fetches the video RAM, so that FLD and other
  effects involving bad lines are now emulated correctly.

- The interrupt handling and the CIA/VIA emulations have been almost
  completely rewritten, thus dramatically increasing compatibility and
  reliability.

- The VIC-II sprite-sprite and sprite-background collision register
  emulation is (much) faster.

- The Read-Modify-Write bug of the CPU is correctly emulated when
  accessing the VIC-II register $D011.

- D64 and T64 can be directly attached (T64 in x64 and x128 only).

- A bad bug in the handling of the I/O registers of the 6510 has been
  fixed.

- The ADC and SBC decimal mode has been fixed.

- Various bugs in the 1541 error channel emulation have been fixed.

- The 1541 emulator and the standalone c1541 program support the Rx:
  (Rename) command and the Sx: (Scratch, delete) command now handles
  wildcards correctly.

- The infamous keyboard problem which caused key events to be lost
  when refresh was > 1 has been fixed.

- A IEEE-488 interface emulator has been introduced (emulates the
  original Commodore one) in x64, x128 and xvic.

- The xdebugger functionality has been improved (this part is still in
  the experimental stage, though).

- The `-8' and `-9' options allow to attach diskimages as drive #9 too.

- The Unix FS driver (Unit 11) has been improved, so that it supports
  the command/error channel and wildcards properly; moreover, new
  FS-specific commands (mkdir, rmdir, chdir) and errors (`permission
  denied' and `directory not empty') have been added.

- The VDC emulation in x128 supports variable character and screen
  size and bitmap mode as well (monochrome only and still under
  development).

- Some minor bugs in the VDC emulator have been fixed.

- The MMU implementation in x128 is much more complete, with true (not
  hard-coded) shared RAM and memory configuration support.

- A nasty bug which caused x128 to crash when changing speed and
  enabling/disabling the video emulators at runtime has been fixed.

- The Linux joystick has been fixed (it did not work at all in 0.10.0).

- The monitor `set' command no longer accepts ambiguous variable names.

- A new `hjoyport' variable/resource allows the user to choose the port
  for the hardware joystick (Linux only).

- Sun64 is no longer supported (if you need it, download x64-0.3.1).

- One thousand other little bugs have been fixed.
