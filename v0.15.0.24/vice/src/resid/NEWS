Changes in reSID version 0.5
----------------------------

Emulation of MOS8580 combined waveforms.

Version string resid_version_string provided for e.g. Autoconf tests.
The string has C linkage.


Changes in reSID version 0.4
----------------------------

The implementation of the ADSR delay bug has been refined and should now be
cycle exact.

The patch for VICE has been removed since VICE 0.15 will include reSID support.


Changes in reSID version 0.3
----------------------------

The reSID library has changed name from libmos6581.a to libresid.a

The pulse+sawtooth combined waveform has been corrected.

Pulse+test bit samples are implemented.

The envelope rate periods have finally been exactly determined.

A new SID bug, the ADSR boundary bug, has been discovered and implemented.
This bug makes it possible to step from envelope level 0x00 to 0xff or from
0xff to 0x00 in one step.

One-cycle optimized overloads of the clock() functions have been implemented
to facilitate sampling at 1MHz.

The code has been further optimized for speed.


Changes in reSID version 0.2
----------------------------

The implementation of the Envelope Generator has been rewritten to handle
the infamous ADSR delay bug. All known envelope related bugs have been
corrected.

The maximum filter resonance is lowered to keep the filter stable.

The reSID API has been simplified. Reading write only registers is allowed.
