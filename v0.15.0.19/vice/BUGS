These are the most important known problems with VICE 0.15.0:

- The custom TextField widget is buggy and can cause crashes on
  DEC/Alpha machines, and possibly on other systems too.  If you get
  weird X protocol errors or the file selector makes the emulator die
  when you close it, this might be the cause.  In that case, recompile
  with the `--disable-textfield' option.  If it still does not work,
  please tell us.

- The VIC-I chip in xvic still lacks important features and is still
  under construction.

- The CRTC chip in xpet and x610 only supports the basic features and
  is still under construction.

- Changing the REU image name via resource files has no effect until
  exiting.

- Dithering on monochrome X11 servers is *very* (VERY!) slow.

- When a key which is shifted on the real machine but unshifted on the
  PC or Unix keyboard you are using is pressed, the virtual shift is
  pressed together (i.e. at the same clock cycle) with the main key;
  this could not work with some keyboard routines.  If you have to
  use the function keys, press the (real) shift key manually (e.g. F2
  = Shift + F1, F4 = Shift + F3 and so on); this also works with other
  keys.

- The C610 emulator, when the execution bank is set to an open memory
  area, sets the zeropage and stack access to unmapped, but actually
  existing memory. This is a bug but cannot be avoided with the current
  CPU code architecture.
