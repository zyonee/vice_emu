   The PIA 6520 is a chip with two I/O ports (Parallel Interface
Adapter) and four additional handshake lines.  The chip is pretty the
same for Port A and B, only that Port A implements handshake on read
operation and port B on write operation.

TPI module
..........

   The TPI 6525 is a chip with three I/O ports (Tri-Port-Interface).
One of the ports can double as an interrupt prioritizer.  Therefore we
also have to save the states of the interrupt stack etc.

ACIA module
...........

   The ACIA 6551 is an RS232 interface chip.  VICE emulates RS232
connections via `/dev/ttyS*' (Unix) or `COM:' (DOS/WIN - not yet?).
When saving a snapshot, those connections are of course lost.  The
state of the ACIA however is restored if possible.  I.e. if a connection
is already open when restoring the snapshot, this connection is used
instead.  If no connection is open, a carrier/DTR drop is emulated.

PET memory module
.................

   The PET memory module actually consists of two modules.  The
"PETMEM" module is mandatory and contains the RAM dump.  The "PETROM"
module is optional and contains a dump of the ROM images.

   The size of the PET memory modules differs with each different memory
configuration.  The RAM configuration is saved in the snapshot, and
restored when the snapshot is loaded.

   Version numbers: Major 1, Minor 0

Monitor
*******

   Every VICE emulator has a complete built-in monitor, which can be
used to examine, disassemble and assemble machine language programs, as
well as debug them through breakpoints.  It can be activated by using
the "Activate monitor" command (left button menu).  Notice that you have
to run the emulator from a terminal emulation program (such as `rxvt'
or `xterm') in order to use the monitor.

   Warning: this version of the monitor is still under construction,
and some of the features are not fully working yet.

Terminology
===========

`address_space'
     This refers to the range of memory locations and a set of
     registers.  This can be the addresses available to the computer's
     processor, the disk drive's processor or a specific memory
     configuration of one of the mentioned processors.

`register'
     One of the following: program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP),
     accumulator (A), X register (X), or Y register (Y).

`address'
     A specific memory location in the range $0000 to $FFFF.

`address_range'
     Two addresses.  If the second address is less than the first, the
     range is assumed to wraparound from $FFFF to $0000.  Both
     addresses must be in the same address space.

`address_opt_range'
     An address or an address range.

`prompt'
     The prompt has the format [x:y].  If x is -, memory reads from the
     monitor do not have side effects.  Otherwise, x is S.  The second
     part of the prompt, y, shows the default address space.

`checkpoint'
     The monitor has the ability to setup triggers that perform an
     action when a specified situation occurs.  There are three types
     of checkpoints; breakpoints, tracepoints and watchpoints.

`breakpoint'
     A breakpoint is triggered based on the program counter.  When it is
     triggered, the monitor is entered.

`tracepoint'
     Like breakpoints, a tracepoint is triggered based on the program
     counter.  Instead of entering the monitor, the program counter is
     printed and execution continues.

`watchpoint'
     Watchpoints are triggered by a read and/or write to an address.
     When a watchpoint is triggered, the monitor is entered.

`<...>'
     A data type.

`*'
     Zero or more occurrences.

`[...]'
     An optional argument.


File: vice.info,  Node: Machine state commands,  Next: Memory commands,  Prev: Terminology,  Up: Monitor

Machine state commands
======================

`goto <address>'
     Change the PC to address and continue execution.

`io'
     Nothing yet.  Will display VIC/VIA/CIA/SID registers.

`next [<count>]'
     Advance to the next instruction.  Subroutines are treated as a
     single instruction.

`registers [<reg_name> = <number> [, <reg_name> = <number>]*]'
     Assign respective registers.  With no parameters, display register
     values.

`return'
     Continues execution  and returns to the monitor just
     before(after?) the next RTS or RTI is executed.

`step [<count>]'
     Single step through instructions.  An optional count allows
     stepping more than a single instruction at a time.


File: vice.info,  Node: Memory commands,  Next: Assembly commands,  Prev: Machine state commands,  Up: Monitor

Memory commands
===============

`compare <address_range> <address>'
     Compare memory from the source specified by the address range to
     the destination specified by the address.  The regions may
     overlap.  Any values that miscompare are displayed using the
     default displaytype.

`fill <address_range> <data_list>'
     Fill memory in the specified address range with the data in
     <data_list>.  If the size of the address range is greater than the
     size of the data_list, the data_list is repeated.

`hunt <address_range> <data_list>'
     Hunt memory in the specified address range for the data in
     <data_list>.  If the data is found, the starting address of the
     match is displayed.  The entire range is searched for all possible
     matches.

`i <address_opt_range>'
     Display memory contents as PETSCII text.

`m [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
     Display the contents of memory.  If no datatype is given, the
     default is used.  If only one address is specified, the length of
     data displayed is based on the datatype.  If no addresses are
     given, the 'dot' address is used.

`mc [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
     Display the contents of memory as character data.  If only one
     address is specified, only one character is displayed.  If no
     addresses are given, the "dot" address is used.

`ms [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
     Display the contents of memory as sprite data.  If only one
     address is specified, only one sprite is displayed.  If no
     addresses are given, the "dot" address is used.

`move <address_range> <address>'
     Move memory from the source specified by the address range to the
     destination specified by the address.  The regions may overlap.

`> [<address>] <data_list>'
     Write the specified data at `address'.

Assembly commands
=================

`a <address> [ <instruction> [: <instruction>]* ]'
     Assemble instructions to the specified address.  If only one
     instruction is specified, enter assembly mode (enter an empty line
     to exit assembly mode).

`d [<address> [<address>]]'
     Disassemble instructions.  If two addresses are specified, they
     are used as a start and end address.  If only one is specified, it
     is treated as the start address and a default number of
     instructions are disassembled.  If no addresses are specified, a
     default number of instructions are disassembled from the dot
     address.


File: vice.info,  Node: Checkpoint commands,  Next: General commands,  Prev: Assembly commands,  Up: Monitor

Checkpoint commands
===================

`break [<address> [if <cond_expr>] ]'
     This command allows setting a breakpoint or listing the current
     breakpoints.  If no address is given, the currently valid
     checkpoints are printed.  If an address is given, a breakpoint is
     set for that address and the breakpoint number is printed.  A
     conditional expression can also be specified for the breakpoint.
     For more information on conditions, see the CONDITION command.

`enable <checknum>'

`disable <checknum>'
     Each checkpoint can be enabled or disabled.  This command allows
     changing between these states.

`command <checknum> "<command>"'
     When checkpoint `checknum' is hit, the specified command is
     executed by the monitor.  Note that the `x' command is not yet
     supported as a command argument.

`condition <checknum> if <cond_expr>'
     Each time the specified checkpoint is examined, the condition is
     evaluated.  If it evalutes to true, the checkpoint is activated.
     Otherwise, it is ignores.  If registers are specified in the
     expression, the values used are those at the time the checkpoint
     is examined, not when the condition is set.

`delete <checknum>'
     Delete the specified checkpoint.

`ignore <checknum> [<count>]'
     Ignore a checkpoint a given number of crossings.  If no count is
     given, the default value is 1.

`trace [address [address]]'
     This command is similar to the `break' command except that it
     operates on tracepoints.  A tracepoint differs from a breakpoint
     by not stopping execution but simply printing the PC, giving the
     user an execution trace.  The second optional address can be used
     to specify the end of an range of addresses to be traced.

`watch [address [address]]'
     This command is similar to the previous two commands except that it
     operates on watchpoints.  A watchpoint differs from the others by
     stopping on a read and/or write to an address or range of
     addresses.  If no addresses are given, a list of all the
     watchpoints is printed.

     argument, the current radix is printed.

`sidefx [on|off|toggle]'
     Control how monitor generated reads affect memory locations that
     have read side-effects.  If the argument is 'on' then reads may
     cause side-effects.  If the argument is 'off' then reads don't
     cause side-effects.  If the argument is 'toggle' then the current
     mode is switched.  No argument displays the current state.

`system <system command>'
     Nothing yet.

c1541
*****

   VICE is provided with a complete stand-alone disk image maintenance
utility, called `c1541'.

   You can either invoke it from the command line or from within one of
the VICE emulators, using the "Run c1541" command which will open a new
`xterm' window with a running `c1541' in it.

   The syntax is:

     c1541 [IMAGE1 [IMAGE2]] [COMMAND1 COMMAND2 ... COMMANDN]

   `IMAGE1' and `IMAGE2' are disk image names that can be attached
before `c1541' starts.  `c1541' can handle up to two disk images at the
same time by using two virtual built-in drives, numbered `8' and `9';
`IMAGE1' (if present) is always attached to drive `8', while `IMAGE2'
is attached to drive `9'.

   `COMMAND's specified on the command-line all begin with the minus
sign (`-'); if present, `c1541' executes them in the same order as they
are on the command line and returns a zero error code if they were
successful.  If any of the `COMMAND's fails, `c1541' stops and returns
a nonzero error code.

   If no `COMMAND's are specified at all, `c1541' enters interactive
mode, where you can type commands manually.  Commands in interactive
mode are the same as commands in batch mode, but do not require a
leading `-'.  As with the monitor, file name completion and command
line editing with history are provided via GNU `readline'.  Use the
command `quit' or press `C-d' to exit.

Specifying files in c1541
=========================

   When accessing CBM DOS files (i.e. files that reside on disk images),
c1541 uses a special syntax that lets you access files on both drive 8
and 9.  If you prepend the file name with `@8:' or `@9:', you will
specified that file is to be found or created on drive 8 and 9,
respectively.

   For instance,

     @8:somefile

   will name file named `somefile' on unit 8, while

     @9:somefile

   will name file named `somefile' on unit 9.


File: vice.info,  Node: c1541 quoting,  Next: c1541 commands and options,  Prev: c1541 file specification,  Up: c1541

Using quotes and backslashes
============================

   You can use quotes (`"') in a command to embed spaces into file
names.  For instance,

     read some file

   will read file `some' from the disk image and write it into the file
system as `file', while

     read "some file"

   will copy `some file' into the file system, with the name `some
file'.

   The backslash character (`\') has a special meaning too: it lets you
literally insert the following character no matter what it is.  For
example,

     read some\ file

   will copy file `some file' into the file system, while

     read some\ file this\"file

   will copy `some file' into the file system with name `this"file'
(with an embedded quote).
