  Additional info

 - The video cache for CRTC doesn't work yet.
 - The window isn't updated anymore when vice is paused


  Reported bugs/problems
--------------------------
 
 - some people reported problems with caps-lock after exiting 
   vice
 - somebody had problems with cs4235 based soundcard 
   (using sound-dialog hangs OS/2)
 - somebody had problems with the attach-dialog and a 
   Matrox g400
 - x128 hangs when closing on some systems. This seems to be a
   problem of the graphic card driver. The use of SciTech
   Display Doctor instead of the drivers solves the problem. It 
   is available from the IBM Device Driver Pack
