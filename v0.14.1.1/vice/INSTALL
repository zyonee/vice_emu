Installation notes for VICE 0.14.1
**********************************


This version of VICE can be compiled and installed both under
Unix/X-Window and MS-DOS, and this file explains how this can be done.


1. What you will need
=====================


  1.1. Unix
  ---------

    To compile VICE under Unix, you basically need a Unix machine
    running the X-Window system version 11 R5 or better, with the
    standard Xt and Xaw libraries.  If you want to use joysticks under
    Linux, you must install the proper joystick module
    (`joystick-0.8.0.tar.gz' or more recent), which is available from
    `sunsite.unc.edu'.  You can also use a customized
    `joystick-0.8.0.1.tar.gz' that has support for digital joysticks
    connected to the parallel port.  This is available from the VICE
    home page (see the `README' file).

    Unlike previous (pre-0.12) versions that only worked with 8-bit
    displays, this release will work with all depths, though 8-bit is
    still highly recommended for best performance.

    VICE has been compiled successfully on the following Unix systems:

      - Various i486/Pentium/Pentium Pro PCs running Linux 2.0.x and
        XFree86 3.2/3.3

      - Some HP9000 (712, 715, 735, 800) machines running HP-UX 9.x
        and 10.x;

      - SUN SPARC 5, 10 and Ultra running Solaris 2.3 or 2.4 (using
        gcc);

      - SUN SPARC 10 running SunOS 4.1 with both X11R4 and X11R5
        (using gcc);

      - SUN SPARC 20 running Linux (2.0.30, RedHat 4.2);

      - SGI Indy R5000 and R4600 running Irix 5.3 and 6.2;

      - AlphaStation 500/533 with Digital Unix 3.2;

      - IBM RS6000 running AIX4.1 (using gcc);

      - MkLinux on Apple Macintosh, Kernel 2.0.33, X11R6.3 (no sound);

    If you compile under a Unix system that is not listed here, please
    tell us.

    If you are compiling on a Pentium machine under Linux or FreeBSD,
    you might consider using the Pentium-specific GCC compiler, which
    is available at `http://www.goof.com/pcg'.  Each time we have
    tried it, and the performance was always at least 20% better (even
    with just `-O2' or `-O3').  Important notice: if you use the
    Pentium-specific GCC, remove all the optimization options (the
    ones that start with `-f') from `CFLAGS' in Makefile and just keep
    a `-On' where `n' is the level of optimization you want.  In fact,
    some of those options are broken and might silently produce wrong
    code!  If you still have troubles, try to #define `NO_REGPARM' to
    avoid passing parameters in the registers to certain functions
    (you can do this by adding `-DNO_REGPARM' to the `CFLAGS', via
    configure or by editing the Makefile by hand).

    Warning: you might need quite a lot of memory to compile VICE with
    full optimizations on some platforms (in particular, this happens
    with the Pentium-specific GCC).  Moreover, archaic versions of GCC
    (e.g. 2.5.x and older) are known to cause trouble.  In that case,
    it is a good idea to upgrade the compiler to a more recent
    version.


  1.2. MS-DOS
  -----------

    The MS-DOS port requires the Allegro library by Shawn Hargreaves
    (`http://talula.demon.co.uk/allegro') and the MIDAS Digital Audio
    System by Petteri Kangaslampi and Jarno Paananen
    (`http://www.s2.org/midas') to be compiled.  Moreover, you also
    need DJGPP, the MS-DOS port of GCC (`http://www.delorie.com').

    Anyway, the current source distribution is only suitable for
    cross-compilation from a Unix system.  This might change in future
    versions.  Help is welcome.


2. Configuring and compiling
============================


  2.1. Compiling under Unix, for Unix or MS-DOS
  ---------------------------------------------

    The release comes with an auto-configuring script created using
    the GNU autoconf package; this script must be executed before
    compiling VICE to detect the characteristics of your machine and
    specify certain features you might want to enable or disable.

    To execute the configuration script, enter the `src' directory of
    the distribution and type:

      ./configure <options>

    There are several options available, and some of them are not
    necessary for the configuration. The important ones are:

      --prefix=PREFIX (default is `/usr/local/')
      --bindir=DIR (default is `PREFIX/bin')
      --mandir=DIR (default is `PREFIX/man')

        Specify the place where the VICE executable and support files
        will be installed.

      --host=HOST

        Specify the host for which the executable will be produced.
        If you want to compile for MS-DOS from a Unix machine using
        GCC, use `--host=i386-go32-gnu'.  If not specified, the
        configure script tries to guess it by itself, so you normally
        don't need to use this option.

      --x-includes=DIR
      --x-libraries=DIR

        Specify the paths for X11 include files and libraries.  The
        configure script is usually smart enough to find them by
        itself if the setup is not too odd; use these option if it is
        not.

      --enable-autobpp
      --enable-8bpp
      --enable-16bpp
      --enable-24bpp

        Specify the bit depth of your X11 display.  The default is
        `autobpp', that enables support for all bit depths (the
        emulator tries to find the ones your server supports by itself
        at runtime).  If you think you are going to use only one type
        of display, specifying this might give you (very) slightly
        better performance.

      --disable-textfield

        Disable Robert W. McMullen's text widget; if you experience
        problems with the text or file manager widgets, you can enable
        the standard Athena one by using this option.  This can also
        be useful if you are using a non-standard Athena-compatible
        library that provides a better looking text widget; it that
        case, using this option will give you that one (this is true
        for neXtaw, for example).
        Problems are known to occur on DEC Alpha systems running
        Digital Unix.

      --with-xaw3d

        Use Xaw3d (instead of plain Xaw) if present.

    (to obtain a complete list of the available options with a
    description, use `./configure --help')

    By default, VICE will be compiled by passing the following options
    to the C compiler:

      `-g -Wall -O5 -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops
       -finline-functions -fno-strength-reduce'
          on Intel-based x86 Unix systems that have gcc installed;

      `-g -Wall -O5 -finline-functions'
          on other systems that have gcc installed;

      `-g'
          on systems that do not have gcc installed.

    If these options do not fit your needs, you can specify what
    options you want by simply passing them in the `CFLAGS' variable,
    e.g. this is something you might want to do on HP-UX:

      CFLAGS="-Ae -g +O3" ./configure

    In the same way, you can force usage of a specific C compiler by
    passing the `CC' variable, e.g.:

      CC="cc" CFLAGS="-Ae -g +O3" ./configure

    If you are running on a Linux system and the joystick module is
    installed properly, the configure script will auto-detect it and
    support for it will be enabled.  Otherwise, the joystick will be
    only emulated with the numeric keypad.

    In case the `configure' script fails or complains about missing
    libraries and you cannot explain this, please send the
    `config.log' file to us together with a precise description of
    your setup; otherwise, we cannot guess what is wrong with it.

    When the configure script has finished, the necessary Makefiles
    will be produced and you can simply type

      make

    to build all the emulators and utilities (`x64', `xvic', `xpet',
    `petcat', `c1541') under the `bin' directory.  It is possible that
    `configure' is not able to find all the needed libraries
    automatically (this is usually due to weird setup); if this
    happens, the script will report a warning message but the
    `Makefile' will be produced anyway.  In this case, you can try to
    re-run `configure' with different options or edit the `Makefile's
    by hand to add the missing options.

    If you are cross-compiling for MS-DOS, check that all the DJGPP
    libraries and include files, together with Allegro, are in the
    right places.

    If you want to install the emulators and utilities, together with
    the documentation and ROM files, just type

      make install

    The binaries and support files will all go under PREFIX/lib/vice;
    in order to provide multiple architectures and versions to be
    installed at once, some links will be created as follows:

      PREFIX/X11/bin/x64 -> PREFIX/lib/vice/ARCH/x64-VERSION

    Where `ARCH' is the autoconf identification string for the
    architecture of the machine you have compiled binaries for
    (e.g. `i586-pc-linux-gnu'), and `VERSION' is the version number
    (in this case, 0.14.1).  Use `strip(1)' on the binary files if you
    like.

    If you want to provide site-specific defaults, you can build a
    `PREFIX/lib/vice/vicerc' resource file that will be loaded by
    default.  Consult the documentation in `doc/MANUAL.html' to see
    how this works.

    If you want to remove VICE from your system, you can use

      make uninstall

    If you want to re-compile with different options, you should do a

      make mrproper

    This will also remove the cache of the `configure' script,
    assuring that all the tests are performed from scratch.


  2.2. Compiling under MS-DOS, for MS-DOS
  ---------------------------------------

    Sorry, no Makefile is currently provided for native MS-DOS
    compilation, mostly because none of us really uses MS-DOS for
    developing.  Volunteers, anyone?  :-)


  2.3. Configuring for multiple architectures
  -------------------------------------------

    As with most packages using GNU autoconf, you can compile VICE for
    multiple architectures from the same source tree.

    To do so, simply create a build directory:

      mkdir {build-dir}

    Then run `configure' from the VICE source tree:

      {vice-source-path}/src/configure

    Of course, you can specify options, flags, etc. as explained on
    par. 2.1.

    After you have configured VICE this way, you can simply compile
    VICE as you would normally do, by typing `make'.

    For example, you might want to do something like this to produce
    and MS-DOS executable of X64 (let's suppose a cross-compiling GCC
    is installed as `gcc-dos' somewhere in your `$PATH'):

      cd sources/vice-0.14.1
      mkdir i386-go32-msdos
      cd i386-go32-msdos
      CC="gcc-dos" CFLAGS="-O5" ../src/configure --host=i386-go32-msdos
      make x64


3. Hints
========

  On Unix, if you are using alternative Xaw libraries (e.g. neXtaw,
  Xaw95, Xaw3d) and you are having troubles with the GUI, try to use
  the standard Xaw first.  There are some incompatibilities that can
  cause them to crash or not to work properly.  Xaw3d should work, but
  in any case please try to use the standard Xaw library before
  reporting bugs.

  If you can, please use GCC (or EGCS) instead of the vendor's CC
  supplied with your machine: it is usually less buggy and produces
  better code.  On certain systems (most notably SunOS), configure
  might completely refuse to use the standard CC.

  Some versions of GCC seem to have troubles with `-funroll-loops' on
  certain architectures; on an Alpha and a SPARC we have tried to
  compile VICE on, the compiler died while trying to optimize the code
  when this option was specified (GCC version 2.7.2).  If you
  experience such a problem, edit Makefile by hand and remove that
  option or reconfigure by specifying the `CFLAGS' as explained above.

  SunOS 4.1.x systems running X11R4 can cause a couple of troubles.
  The first one is that `configure' might not find `-lXmu' and `-lXaw'
  properly, because of some issues related to dynamic libraries.  This
  would need some custom `configure' checks, which might be made
  available in future versions.  For now, just edit the `Makefile'
  after it has been created by `configure' and add `-lXaw -lXmu' (in
  this order) before `-lXt' on the `LIBS=...' line.  Moreover, you
  might get undefined references to

    _get_wmShellWidgetClass
    _get_applicationShellWidgetClass

  when linking `x64', `xvic' or `xpet'.  In that case you have to link
  `-lXmu' statically (default is dynamically).  This can be done by
  editing the `Makefile' by hand and replacing `-lXmu' with `-Bstatic
  -lXmu -Bdynamic' in the `LIBS=...'  line.  A simplier way is to link
  *everything* statically; this can be achieved by running `configure'
  like this:

    LDFLAGS="-static" ./configure

  This will build much bigger executables, though.
