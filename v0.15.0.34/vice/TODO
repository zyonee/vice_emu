What are we going to do next
============================

* General improvements
----------------------

- Write real MS-DOS documentation (any volunteers?).

- Allow tape loading without the virtually pressed "Play" button,
  which can break some programs that do not like it to be pressed
  (e.g. Turbo Assembler).

- Emulate shifted keys more accurately by delaying the shifted key
  after the shift.

- Emulate the RESTORE key more accurately.

- Better support for alternative ROM sets.

- Some more kernal patches, for instance for changing colors and
  patching the reset routine to make it faster (maybe configurable).

- More ports.  Any volunteers?  MacOS, Win32 and Acorn RISC-OS ports
  are in the works; if you want to help, please let us know.

* C64 improvements
------------------

- Better handling for REU load/save.  It would be nice to have a few
  menu entries to do this.

- More accurate REU emulation, with 16 Mbyte mode.

* C128 improvements
-------------------

- Support missing keys (Caps Lock, 40/80 Display).

* VIC20 improvements
--------------------

- Better, possibly cycle-based, emulation of the VIC-I chip.

- Improve the accuracy of the audio emulation.

* PET improvements
------------------

- Complete CRTC emulation.

* Plus/4
--------

- Implement a Plus/4 emulator.
