<P>
VICE derives from X64, the first Commodore 64 emulator for the X Window
System.  Here is an informal list of the people who were mostly involved
in the development of X64 and VICE:

</P>
<P>
The VICE core team:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

<B>Ettore Perazzoli</B> (@email{ettore@comm2000.it}) made the 6510, VIC-II,
VIC-I and CRTC emulations, part of the hardware-level 1541
emulation, speed optimizations, bug fixes, the event-driven
cycle-exact engine, the Xt/Xaw/Xfwf-based GUI for X11, a
general code reorganization, the new resource handling, most of
the documentation.  He also wrote the MS-DOS port and the
initial MS-Windows port (well, somebody had to do it).

<LI>

<B>Daniel Sladic</B> (@email{sladic@eecg.toronto.edu}) started the work on
hardware-level 1541 emulation and wrote the new monitor
introduced with VICE 0.15.

<LI>

<B>Andreas Boose</B> (@email{boose@linux.rz.fh-hannover.de}) gave lots of
information and bug reports about the VIC-II, the 6510 and the
CIAs; moreover, he wrote several test-routines that were used
to improve the emulation.  He also added cartridge support and
has been the main head behind the drive and datasette emulation
since version 0.15.  Also added several UI elements to the MSDOS
and MS-Windows ports and the C128 Z80 implementation.

<LI>

<B>Dag Lem</B> (@email{resid@nimrod.no}) implemented the reSID SID emulation
engine.

<LI>

<B>Tibor Biczo</B> (@email{crown@mail.matav.hu}) improved the MS-Windows port.

<LI>

<B>Andreas Dehmel</B> (@email{dehmel@forwiss.tu-muenchen.de}) wrote the Acorn
RISC OS port.

<LI>

<B>Thomas Bretz</B> (@email{tbretz@ph.tum.de}) responsible for the OS/2 port.

<LI>

<B>Andreas Matthies</B> (@email{andreas.matthies@arcormail.de}) improved the
datasette support and some ui stuff in the Win32 and MSDOS port. Wrote the
BeOS port.

<LI>

<B>Martin Pottendorfer</B> (@email{Martin.Pottendorfer@aut.alcatel.at})
Implemented Gnome Port based on Oliver Schaertels GTK+ port
Added support code for internationalization based on gettext
Translated the Unix Port to German
Implemented the fliplists + ui (unix).

<LI>

<B>Markus Brenner</B> (@email{markus@brenner.de}) added VDC emulation to x128.

<UL>

<LI>

<B>Andre Fachat</B> (@email{fachat@physik.tu-chemnitz.de}) wrote the PET
and CBM-II emulators, the CIA and VIA emulation, the IEEE488
interface, implemented the IEC serial bus in `xvic' and made
tons of bug fixes.

<LI>

<B>Teemu Rantanen</B> (@email{tvr@cs.hut.fi}) implemented the SID emulation
and the trap-based disk drive and serial bus implementation;
added support for multiple display depths under X11.  Also wrote
`c1541'

<LI>

<B>Jouko Valta</B> (@email{jopi@stekt.oulu.fi}) wrote <CODE>petcat</CODE> and
<CODE>c1541</CODE>, <CODE>T64</CODE> handling, user service and
maintenance (most of the work in x64 0.3.x was made by him); retired
from the project in July 96, after VICE 0.10.0.

<LI>

<B>Jarkko Sonninen</B> (@email{sonninen@lut.fi}) was the founder of the
project, wrote the old version of the 6502 emulation and the XDebugger,
and retired from the project after x64 0.2.1.
