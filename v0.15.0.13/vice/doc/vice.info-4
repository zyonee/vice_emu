File: vice.info,  Node: Memory commands,  Next: Assembly commands,  Prev: Machine state commands,  Up: Monitor

Memory commands
===============

`compare <address_range> <address>'
     Compare memory from the source specified by the address range to
     the destination specified by the address.  The regions may
     overlap.  Any values that miscompare are displayed using the
     default displaytype.

`fill <address_range> <data_list>'
     Fill memory in the specified address range with the data in
     <data_list>.  If the size of the address range is greater than the
     size of the data_list, the data_list is repeated.

`hunt <address_range> <data_list>'
     Hunt memory in the specified address range for the data in
     <data_list>.  If the data is found, the starting address of the
     match is displayed.  The entire range is searched for all possible
     matches.

`i <address_opt_range>'
     Display memory contents as PETSCII text.

`m [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
     Display the contents of memory.  If no datatype is given, the
     default is used.  If only one address is specified, the length of
     data displayed is based on the datatype.  If no addresses are
     given, the 'dot' address is used.

`mc [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
     Display the contents of memory as character data.  If only one
     address is specified, only one character is displayed.  If no
     addresses are given, the "dot" address is used.

`ms [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
     Display the contents of memory as sprite data.  If only one
     address is specified, only one sprite is displayed.  If no
     addresses are given, the "dot" address is used.

`move <address_range> <address>'
     Move memory from the source specified by the address range to the
     destination specified by the address.  The regions may overlap.

`> [<address>] <data_list>'
     Write the specified data at `address'.


File: vice.info,  Node: Assembly commands,  Next: Checkpoint commands,  Prev: Memory commands,  Up: Monitor

Assembly commands
=================

`a <address> [ <instruction> [: <instruction>]* ]'
     Assemble instructions to the specified address.  If only one
     instruction is specified, enter assembly mode (enter an empty line
     to exit assembly mode).

`d [<address> [<address>]]'
     Disassemble instructions.  If two addresses are specified, they
     are used as a start and end address.  If only one is specified, it
     is treated as the start address and a default number of
     instructions are disassembled.  If no addresses are specified, a
     default number of instructions are disassembled from the dot
     address.


File: vice.info,  Node: Checkpoint commands,  Next: General commands,  Prev: Assembly commands,  Up: Monitor

Checkpoint commands
===================

`break [<address> [if <cond_expr>] ]'
     This command allows setting a breakpoint or listing the current
     breakpoints.  If no address is given, the currently valid
     checkpoints are printed.  If an address is given, a breakpoint is
     set for that address and the breakpoint number is printed.  A
     conditional expression can also be specified for the breakpoint.
     For more information on conditions, see the CONDITION command.

`enable <checknum>'
`disable <checknum>'
     Each checkpoint can be enabled or disabled.  This command allows
     changing between these states.

`command <checknum> "<command>"'
     When checkpoint `checknum' is hit, the specified command is
     executed by the monitor.  Note that the `x' command is not yet
     supported as a command argument.

`condition <checknum> if <cond_expr>'
     Each time the specified checkpoint is examined, the condition is
     evaluated.  If it evalutes to true, the checkpoint is activated.
     Otherwise, it is ignores.  If registers are specified in the
     expression, the values used are those at the time the checkpoint
     is examined, not when the condition is set.

`delete <checknum>'
     Delete the specified checkpoint.

`ignore <checknum> [<count>]'
     Ignore a checkpoint a given number of crossings.  If no count is
     given, the default value is 1.

`trace [address [address]]'
     This command is similar to the `break' command except that it
     operates on tracepoints.  A tracepoint differs from a breakpoint
     by not stopping execution but simply printing the PC, giving the
     user an execution trace.  The second optional address can be used
     to specify the end of an range of addresses to be traced.

`watch [address [address]]'
     This command is similar to the previous two commands except that it
     operates on watchpoints.  A watchpoint differs from the others by
     stopping on a read and/or write to an address or range of
     addresses.  If no addresses are given, a list of all the
     watchpoints is printed.


File: vice.info,  Node: General commands,  Next: Disk commands,  Prev: Checkpoint commands,  Up: Monitor

General commands
================

`cd <directory>'
     Change the working directory.

`device [c:|d:]'
     Set the default memory device to either the computer (`c:') or the
     disk (`d:').

`radix [H|D|O|B]'
     Set the default radix to hex, decimal, octal, or binary.  With no
     argument, the current radix is printed.

`sidefx [on|off|toggle]'
     Control how monitor generated reads affect memory locations that
     have read side-effects.  If the argument is 'on' then reads may
     cause side-effects.  If the argument is 'off' then reads don't
     cause side-effects.  If the argument is 'toggle' then the current
     mode is switched.  No argument displays the current state.

`system <system command>'
     Nothing yet.


File: vice.info,  Node: Disk commands,  Next: Command file commands,  Prev: General commands,  Up: Monitor

Disk commands
=============

`br <track> <sector> [<address>]'
     Read the block at the specified track and sector.  If an address is
     specified, the data is loaded into memory.  If no address is
     given, the data is displayed using the default datatype.

`bw <track> <sector> <address>'
     Write a block of data at `address' to the specified track and
     sector of disk in drive 8.

`@<disk command>'
     Perform a disk command on the currently attached disk image on
     drive 8.  The specified disk command is sent to the drive's
     channel #15.

`load "<filename>" <address>'
     Load the specified file into memory at the specified address.

`save "<filename>" <address1> <address2>'
     Save the memory from address1 to address2 to the specified file.


File: vice.info,  Node: Command file commands,  Next: Label commands,  Prev: Disk commands,  Up: Monitor

Command file commands
=====================

`playback "<filename>"'
     Monitor commands from the specified file are read and executed.
     This command stops at the end of file or when a STOP command is
     read.

`record "<filename>"'
     After this command, all commands entered are written to the
     specified file until the STOP command is entered.

`stop'
     Stop recording commands.  See `record'.


File: vice.info,  Node: Label commands,  Next: Miscellaneous commands,  Prev: Command file commands,  Up: Monitor

Label commands
==============

`add_label <address> <label>'
     Map a given address to a label.  This label can be used when
     entering assembly code and is shown during disassembly.

`delete_label [<memspace>] <label>'
     Remove the specified label from the label tables.  If no memory
     space is checked, all tables are checked.

`load_labels [<memspace>] "<filename>"'
     Load a file containing a mapping of labels to addresses.  If no
     memory space is specified, the default readspace is used.

`save_labels [<memspace>] "<filename>"'
     Save labels to a file.  If no memory space is specified, all of the
     labels are saved.

`show_labels [<memspace>]'
     Display current label mappings.  If no memory space is specified,
     show all labels.

c1541
*****

   VICE is provided with a complete stand-alone disk image maintenance
utility, called `c1541'.  You can either invoke it from the command
line or from within one of the VICE emulators, using the "Run c1541"
command which will open a new `xterm' window with a running `c1541' in
it.

   The syntax is:

     c1541 OPTIONS IMAGE

   If some `OPTIONS' but no `IMAGE' are specified, `c1541' runs in
batch mode; otherwise, it attaches the `IMAGE' if present and enters
interactive mode, where you can type commands that are executed when
you press Enter (abbreviations are allowed).  As with the monitor, file
name completion and command line editing with history are provided via
GNU `readline'.  Use the command `quit' to exit.

   Notice that `c1541' always creates `X64' files, but can read and
write `D64' and `T64' files automatically, without the need for any
special options.

Acknowledgments
***************

   VICE derives from X64, the first Commodore 64 emulator for the X
Window System.  Here is an informal list of the people who were mostly
involved in the development of X64 and VICE:

   The VICE core team:

   * Ettore Perazzoli (<ettore@comm2000.it>) made the 6510, VIC-II,
     VIC-I and CRTC emulations, part of the hardware-level 1541
     emulation, speed optimizations, bug fixes, the event-driven
     cycle-exact engine, the Xt/Xaw/Xfwf-based GUI for X11, a general
     code reorganization, the new resource handling, most of the
     documentation and the MS-DOS port (well, somebody had to do it).

   * Teemu Rantanen (<tvr@cs.hut.fi>) implemented the SID emulation and
     the trap-based disk drive and serial bus implementation; added
     support for multiple display depths under X11.

   * Andr'e Fachat (<fachat@physik.tu-chemnitz.de>) wrote the PET
     emulators, the CIA and VIA emulation, the IEEE488 interface,
     implemented the IEC serial bus in `xvic' and made tons of bug
     fixes.

   * Daniel Sladic (<sladic@eecg.toronto.edu>) started the work on
     hardware-level 1541 emulation and wrote the new monitor introduced
     with VICE 0.15.

   * Andreas Boose (<boose@linux.rz.fh-hannover.de>) gave lots of
     information and bug reports about the VIC-II, the 6510 and the
     CIAs; moreover, he wrote several test-routines that were used to
     improve the emulation.  Also contributed some important patches,
     fixed several problems in the 1541 emulation, implemented the
     SpeedDOS parallel cable emulation and added cartridge support.

   Former team members:

   * Jouko Valta (<jopi@stekt.oulu.fi>) wrote `petcat' and `c1541',
     `T64' handling, user service and maintenance (most of the work in
     x64 0.3.x was made by him); retired from the project in July 96,
     after VICE 0.10.0.

   * Jarkko Sonninen (<sonninen@lut.fi>) was the founder of the
     project, wrote the old version of the 6502 emulation and the
     XDebugger, and retired from the project after x64 0.2.1.

   External contributors:

   * Michael Schwendt (<sidplay@geocities.com>) helped with the SID
     (audio) chip emulation, bringing important suggestions and bug
     reports, as well as the wave tables and filter emulation from his
     SIDplay emulator.

   * Christian Bauer (<bauec002@goofy.zdv.uni-mainz.de>) wrote the very
     interesting "VIC article" from which we got invaluable information
     about the VIC-II chip: without this, the VIC-II implementation
     would have not been possible.

   * Wolfgang Lorenz wrote an excellent 6510 test suite that helped us
     to debug the CPU emulation.

   * Giuliano Procida (<gpp10@cam.ac.uk>) is the maintainer of the VICE
     `deb' package for the Debian distribution, and also helped
     proofreading the documentation.

   * Marko M"akel"a (<msmakela@nic.funet.fi>) wrote lots of CPU
     documentation.

   * Martin Pottendorfer (<Martin.Pottendorfer@aut.alcatel.at>)
     implemented the "Contents" button in the file selector and
     provided us with several suggestions and constant testing of
     constantly broken snapshots.

   * Chris Sharp (<sharpc@hurlsey.ibm.com>) wrote the AIX sound driver.

   * Krister Walfridsson (<cato@df.lth.se>) implemented joystick and
     sound support for NetBSD.

   * Dag Lem (<resid@nimrod.no>) implemented an alternative cycle-exact
     SID emulator (reSID), and contributed a bugfix in our SID
     emulation.

   * Peter Andrew Felvegi aka Petschy (<petschy@derceto.sch.bme.hu>)
     fixed a couple of bugs in the fast serial emulation.

   * Olaf Seibert (<rhialto@polder.ubc.kun.nl>) contributed some PET,
     and disk drive patches.

   * Daniel Fandrich (<dan@fch.wimsey.bc.ca>) contributed some disk
     drive patches.

   * Heiko Selber (<selber@fhi-berlin.mpg.de>) contributed some VIC20
     I/O patches.

   * Steven Tieu (<stieu@physics.ubc.ca>) added initial support for
     16/24 bpp X11 displays.

   * Alexander Lehmann (<alex@mathematik.th-darmstadt.de>) added
     complete support for all the VIC20 memory configurations for the
     old VICE 0.12.

   * Lionel Ulmer implemented joystick support for Linux and a first
     try of a SID emulation for SGI machines.

   * Bernhard Kuhn (<kuhn@eikon.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de>) made some
     joystick improvements for Linux.

   * Gerhard Wesp (<gwesp@cosy.sbg.ac.at>) contributed the `extract'
     command in `c1541'.

   * Ricardo Ferreira (<storm@esoterica.pt>) contributed the `unlynx'
     and `system' commands in `c1541'.

   * Tomi Ollila (<Tomi.Ollila@tfi.net>) donated `findpath.c'.

   * Richard Hable (<hab@fim.uni-linz.ac.at>) contributed the initial
     version of the REU Emulation.

   * Vesa-Matti Puro (<vmp@lut.fi>) wrote the very first 6502 CPU
     emulator in x64 0.1.0. That was the beginning of the story...

   * Dan Miner (<dminer@nyx10.cs.du.edu>) contributed some patches to
     the fast disk drive emulation.

   * Frank Prindle (<Frank.Prindle@lambada.oit.unc.edu>) contributed
     some patches.

   * Peter Weighill (<stuce@csv.warwick.ac.uk>) gave many ideas and
     contributed the ROM patcher.

   * Dominique Strigl (<strigl@sxb.bsf.alcatel.fr>), Craig Jackson
     (<Craig.Jackson@lambada.oit.unc.edu>) and Lasse Jyrkinen
     ((<Lasse.Jyrkinen@uz.kuleuven.ac.be>) contributed miscellaneous
     patches in the old X64 times.

   * Per Olofsson (<MagerValp@Goth.Org>) digitalized the C64 colors
     used in the default palette.

   * Paul David Doherty (<h0142kdd@rz.hu-berlin.de>) wrote `zip2disk',
     on which the Zipcode support in `c1541' is based.

   * Robert H. Forsman Jr., Brian Totty (<totty@cs.uiuc.edu>) and
     Robert W. McMullen (<rwmcm@orion.ae.utexas.edu>) provided the
     widget set for implementing the `Xaw' GUI.

   * Shawn Hargreaves (<shawn@talula.demon.co.uk>) wrote Allegro, the
     graphics and audio library used in the MS-DOS version.

   (We hope we have not forgotten anybody; if you think we have, please
tell us.)

   Thanks also to everyone else for sending suggestions, ideas, bug
reports, questions and requests.  In particular, a warm thank goes to
the following people:

   * Lutz Sammer

   * Ralph Mason (<RALPHM@msmail02.liffe.com>)

How to send feedback
====================

   If you want to report bugs, make suggestions or contribute to the
project, please email one of the following people:

   * Teemu Rantanen (<tvr@cs.hut.fi>) for the SID stuff;

   * Andreas Boose (<boose@linux.rz.fh-hannover.de>) for the 1541 disk
     drive;

   * Andr'e Fachat (<fachat@physik.tu-chemnitz.de>) for the PETs;

   * Ettore Perazzoli (<ettore@comm2000.it>), the current maintainer,
     for everything else.

   It's always nice to receive feedback and/or bugreports about VICE,
but please read these few notes before sending mail to anybody in the
team.

   * Please put the word `VICE' *in all capitals* in your subject line
     (e.g., `VICE fails to run game XXX').  This helps mail splitting
     and reduces chances that your message is unintentionally deleted,
     forgotten or lost.

   * Please don't send any HTML mail (we really hate that!).  If you use
     M$ Outlook or Netscape Communicator, make sure you turn off the
     "rich text" (HTML) feature.

   * Please don't send *any* binaries without asking first.

   * Please read the following documents carefully before reporting a
     bug or a problem you cannot solve:

        * the VICE documentation (you are reading it!);

        * the VICE FAQ (it is available on the Internet, and reachable
          from the VICE home page:
          http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~fachat/vice/vice.html);

        * the `comp.emulators.cbm' and `comp.sys.cbm' FAQs (*note FAQs
          you should read::.).

   * When you report a bug, please try to be as accurate as possible and
     describe how it can be reproduced to the very detail.  You should
     also tell us what machine you are running on, what operating
     system you are using as well as the version of it.

   * Please don't ask us how to transfer original C64 disk or tapes to
     your PC; this has been asked a gazillion times through email.  To
     transfer disks, you can use the Star Commander
     (http://ludens.elte.hu/~sta/sc.html).  And no, you cannot read C64
     disks with your old 5"1/4 PC drive.

   * Please don't ask us where to find games for the emulator on the
     Internet.

   * Please don't ask us when the next version will be out, because we
     really don't know.

   * Please write in English, or in the language of the person you are
     writing to (Ettore is Italian, Andr'e and Andreas are German,
     Teemu is Finnish, Daniel is from Canada).

How to contribute
=================

   If you want to make a major contribution, please *ask* first.  It
has already happened a couple of times that somebody started working at
something that had already been done but not released to the public yet,
and we really do *not* want anybody to waste time.

   If you are going to make a patch, please make sure the patch is
relative to the very latest version, and provide us with the following:

   * a diff file containing all the changes you have made (`diff -c' or
     `diff -u' (better) is fine; please don't use plain `diff');

   * GNU-style `ChangeLog' entries with a description of the changes you
     have made (look at the `ChangeLog's provided with the original VICE
     sources for an example).

   This is very important, and makes adding patches much smoother and
safer.

   People willing to port VICE to other platforms are always welcome.  A
Windows and a MacOS port are in the works, so if you are interested in
those platforms, please let us know.  There is plenty of work to do and
any sort of help can be very useful.

Interesting newsgroups
======================

   There are some Usenet newsgroups you might be interested in:

   * `comp.emulators.cbm', discussing about emulators of Commodore 8-bit
     machines (definitely not Amiga emulators).

   * `comp.sys.cbm', discussing various topics regarding real Commodore
     8-bit machines.  This newsgroup is mainly for people who actually
     use original Commodore equipment (so please don't talk about
     emulation here).

   * `comp.emulators.misc', discussing emulators in general.

FAQs you should read
====================

   We recommend reading the `comp.emulators.cbm' and `comp.sys.cbm'
FAQs, which are posted regularly on the corresponding newsgroups and
are also available via FTP from ftp://rtfm.mit.edu.
