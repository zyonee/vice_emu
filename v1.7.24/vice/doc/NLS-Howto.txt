Here it is a little README about NSL in VICE. I really hope it will be
helpful. 
Let me know your kind remarks.

Bye,

Andrea.

0 Introduction
--------------

This version of VICE contains national language support (NLS) using
the GNU (or OS-supplied) gettext library. gettext eases the handling
of translations of (usually English) output messages to other
languages by introducing the concept of message catalogs.

Message catalogs can exist in various formats. The human-readable and
-editable format is the PO file format. These human-readable files are
then translated to MO files which can be used by the gettext library.

Please refer to the GNU gettext documentation ('info gettext') for 
further details.


1 Compiling VICE with localized messages
----------------------------------------

VICE is compiled by default with NLS enabled. If you don't want
NLS invoke configure with the option

./configure --disable-nls

If you don't know how to compile VICE, please read the INSTALL file.


2 Changing language settings
----------------------------

You have to set the `LANG' environment variable to the appropriate
language code before using VICE. ISO 639 language codes can be found
in the gettext manual.

For example, if you speak Swedish, just type `export LANG=sv' at the 
BASH prompt. This can be done from your `.login' or `.profile' file, 
once and for all.


3 Adding new messages
---------------------

1. Edit the ALL_LINGUAS line in 'configure.in' and add your
   language code, eg. Italian:

   ALL_LINGUAS="de sv fr it"

2. Execute 'autoconf' to create a new 'configure' script.

3. Now issue './configure'.

4. Go to the 'po' subdirectory.

5. Do a 'cp vice.pot it.po'. 'vice.pot' is is the common ground 
   for the translation teams to produce one PO for their language.

6. Now use the editor of your choice to provide translations in
   'it.po'. There is an emacs major mode (po-mode) that eases this
   process.

7. Now issue 'make'. This causes an 'it.gmo' to be created.

8. Do a 'make install' to install 'it.gmo' to the appropriate directory.


4 Updating messages
-------------------

VICE messages change at every release. Go to the 'po' subdirectory and 
do a 'make update-po'. This updates all existing PO-files (removing 
obsolete translations, providing new, emptry entries). Check 'it.po' and
provide translations for the new, empty entries.
