This document describes how to compile the GP2X port.


First of all you will need to install DevkitGP2X or Open2x toolchain,
and make sure the cross-toolchain binaries are in the PATH.

After installing DevkitGP2X you will need to copy or make links for the 
following files:

arm-linux-ar     to arm-gp2x-linux-ar
arm-linux-g++    to arm-gp2x-linux=g++
arm-linux-gcc    to arm-gp2x-linux-gcc
arm-linux-ranlib to arm-gp2x-linux-ranlib
arm-linux-strip  to arm-gp2x-linux-strip

(NOTE: this is not needed for Open2x)

After doing this you will be able to use the --host configure option for 
VICE to have it build the GP2X port. In other words, you just use:

(with DevkitGP2X)
./configure --host=arm-gp2x-linux

(with Open2x toolchain)
./configure --host=arm-open2x-linux

And the configure script will try to find and use the correct 
cross-toolchain (arm-{gp2x,open2x}-linux-*), and set the correct CFLAGS 
and LDFLAGS for the GP2X port.

After the compile is done you can use 'make bindist' to create a binary 
distribution directory, or use 'make bindistzip' to create a binary 
distribution zip archive.
