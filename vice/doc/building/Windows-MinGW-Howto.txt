Vice on Windows - The Next G(TK)eneration
=========================================

This is some quick instructions on getting Vice compiled on Windows under MinGW

1. Get msys2:
http://www.msys2.org/
Install as per that webpage, but don't bother with step 7 (GIT), unless you actually want GIT.


2. Install the stuff you actually need to build (found by trial & error..)
NOTE - this assumes you installed the 64 bit version of msys2...

Launch MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit and run the following to install your prerequisites:

pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3 mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain base-devel

(hit enter for default on all the prompts, then wait for the 300MB of stuff to download and install)


3. You need the xa 6502 compiler which you will have to download and install the hard way from:
http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/
Download, unpack to e.g.:
C:\msys64\home\user\xa-2.3.8
Then at the msys prompt e.g.:

cd ~\xa-2.3.8
make
make install


4. Now you can try to build it. Note the below assumes your source is in c:\src\vice\

At the MSYS prompt run:

cd /c/src/vice/vice
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-native-gtk3ui
make
make bindist


5. If it got through all those steps you should have some executables to play with in C:\src\vice\vice\WinVICE-3.*
