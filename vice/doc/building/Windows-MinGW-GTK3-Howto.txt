Vice on Windows - The Next G(TK)eneration
=========================================

This is some quick instructions on getting Vice with the GTK3 GUI compiled on Windows under MinGW.

1. Get msys2 (includes mingw):
http://www.msys2.org/
Install as per that webpage, but don't bother with step 7 (GIT), unless you actually want GIT.


2. Install the stuff you actually need to build vice:
NOTE - this assumes you installed the 64 bit version of msys2...

Launch MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit and run the following to install your prerequisites:
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3 mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain base-devel
(Hit enter for default on all the prompts, then wait for the 300MB of stuff to download and install.)

You might also want SVN to get/manage the source (or you could use a gui like e.g. TortoiseSVN):
$ pacman -S subversion


3. You need the xa 6502 compiler which you will have to download and install:
http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/
Download, unpack to e.g.:
C:\msys64\home\user\xa-2.3.8
Then at the msys prompt e.g.:
$ cd ~/xa-2.3.8
$ make
$ make install


4. You also need the ntldd utility for making the distribution:
https://github.com/LRN/ntldd
Download zip, unpack to e.g.
C:\msys64\home\user\ntldd-master
Compile with it's supplied script from MSYS2:
$ cd ~/ntldd-master
$ ./makeldd.cmd
$ cp ntldd.exe /usr/local/bin


5. Now you can try to build Vice:
Note the below assumes your source is in c:\src\vice\
At the MSYS2 prompt run:
$ cd /c/src/vice/vice
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --enable-native-gtk3ui
$ make
$ make bindist


6. If it got through all those steps you should have some executables to play with in ..\vice\vice\GTK3VICE-3.*

Enjoy!
