SCOPE
  We will try to fill in some blanks found in the popular VIC-Article.txt
by Christian Bauer.


MODELS
  This document will try to note differences between different chip models
and revisions where applicable.  Currently only PAL models are considered.

[6569R1] 6569R1 (oldest 5 luma version)
[6569]   6569R3 and above.
[8565]   8565R2 and above (I have only seen R2)
[8566]   8566 as found in the C128[CR/D]


TEST PROGRAMS
  References in the form [T:*] refer to test programs available at

Sprite idle fetch
-----------------
Whatever appears on the VIC-II internal bus during the fetch cycles
is displayed.  That is both loads and stores to the VIC-II, or $ff if
no access occurs.


Sprite crunch
-------------
Rules 7 and 8 in the article section 3.8.1 do not cover sprite crunch in full.
A more accurate replacement for both rules:

7. In the first phase of cycle 16, it is checked if the expansion flip flop
   is set. If so, MCBASE load from MC (MC->MCBASE), unless the CPU cleared
   the Y expansion bit in $d017 in the second phase of cycle 15, in which case
   MCBASE is set to X = (101010 & (MCBASE & MC)) | (010101 & (MCBASE | MC)).
   After the MCBASE update, the VIC checks if MCBASE is equal to 63 and turns
   off the DMA of the sprite if it is.

Note: The original rule 8 mentions turning the display of the sprite off
if MCBASE is equal to 63. If this were true, then the last line of the sprite
would not be displayed beyond coordinates corresponsing to cycle 16.
The above rewritten rule corrects this. The actual disabling of sprite display
is likely handled during the first phase of cycle 58 (see rule 4).


Raster IRQ
----------
Raster comparison is edge triggered.  If $d012 is changed to always
follow the raster counter it will never trigger an IRQ condition.

This can be seen in patent US4572506.

Light pen
---------
Light pen doesn't trigger in line 311.
Light pen retriggers on the start of the frame if the line is held low.

6569 is one pixel higher than 8565 except when retriggered at the start
of frame.
6569R1 only triggers IRQ during start of frame.

Start of frame
--------------
Start of frame occurs one cycle late after line 311 ends.
Line timing wraps normally at cycle 63.


Fetch
-----
Switching from VC to VMLI addressing will create a glitch
on 6569, but not on 8565.

Video bank and C64C
-------------------
The glue logic on a C64C will generate a glitch during 10 <-> 01
generating 00 (in other words, bank 3) for one cycle.

When using the data direction register to change a single bit 0->1
(in other words, decreasing the video bank number by 1 or 2),
the bank change is delayed by one cycle. This effect is unstable.
