"novte" is a stripped down library based on vte-0.52.2

the purpose of the resulting code is to be used for the ml monitor in VICE, and
to do that in a portable way that would work on all GTK3 targets.

what was removed from VTE:

- everything that deals with regular expressions, and thus the need for libpcre2
- all support for pty, and the requirement for termios
- gnutls support, and warning about no support

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

right now the use of this "novte" replacement is forced, if you want for some
reason check if things work/behave different with real vte, remove the
"#define USE_NOVTE" things at the top of the following files:

src/arch/gtk3/linenoise.c
src/arch/gtk3/uimon.c
src/arch/gtk3/uimon-fallback.c
