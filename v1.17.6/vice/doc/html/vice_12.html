VICE derives from X64, the first Commodore 64 emulator for the X Window
System.  Here is an informal list of the people who were mostly involved
in the development of X64 and VICE:

</P>
<P>
The VICE core team:

<UL>

<LI>

<B>Daniel Sladic</B> started the work on hardware-level 1541 emulation
and wrote the new monitor introduced with VICE 0.15.

<LI>

<B>Andreas Boose</B> gave lots of
information and bug reports about the VIC-II, the 6510 and the
CIAs; moreover, he wrote several test-routines that were used
to improve the emulation.  He also added cartridge support and
has been the main head behind the drive and datasette emulation
since version 0.15.  Also added several UI elements to the
MSDOS and MS-Windows ports. He rewrote the C128 emulation
adding Z80 mode, C64 mode and function ROM support.

<LI>

<B>Dag Lem</B> implemented the reSID SID emulation
engine.

<LI>

<B>Tibor Biczo</B> improved the MS-Windows port.

<LI>

<B>Andreas Dehmel</B> wrote the Acorn RISC OS port.

<LI>

<B>Thomas Bretz</B> responsible for the OS/2 port.

<LI>

<B>Andreas Matthies</B> improved the
datasette support, the VIC20 video emulation and some ui stuff
in the Win32 and MSDOS port. He also wrote the BeOS port.

<LI>

<B>Martin Pottendorfer</B>
Implemented Gnome Port based on Oliver Schaertels GTK+ port
Added support code for internationalization based on gettext
Translated the Unix Port to German
Implemented the fliplists + ui (unix).

<LI>

<B>Markus Brenner</B> added VDC emulation to x128
and added support for some more cartridges.

<LI>

<B>Spiro Trikaliotis</B> wrote the Win32
console implementation for the built-in monitor and provided
some further patches.

<LI>

<B>Marco van den Heuvel</B> Translated the UI to Dutch.
Internationalization support for the Win32 port. Wrote the
GEORAM cartridge code. Wrote the Ramcart cartridge code.
Wrote the +60K Expansion code. Made the ethernet support
for the Msdos port. Maintains the QNX 6.x binary packages.
Maintains the Solaris binary packages. Fixed stereo-sid/acia
io-1/io-2 conflicts. And lots of other fixes.

Former team members:

<UL>

<LI>

<B>Ettore Perazzoli</B>
Copyright (C) 1996-1999
Made the 6510, VIC-II, VIC-I and CRTC emulations, part of the
hardware-level 1541 emulation, speed optimizations, bug fixes,
the event-driven cycle-exact engine, the Xt/Xaw/Xfwf-based GUI
for X11, a general code reorganization, the new resource
handling, most of the documentation.  He also wrote the MS-DOS
port and the initial MS-Windows port (well, somebody had to do
it).

<LI>

<B>André Fachat</B>
Copyright (C) 1996-2001
Wrote the PET and CBM-II emulators, the CIA and VIA emulation,
the IEEE488 interface, implemented the IEC serial bus in `xvic'
and made tons of bug fixes.

<LI>

<B>Teemu Rantanen</B>
Copyright (C) 1993-1994, 1997-1999
Implemented the SID emulation and the trap-based disk drive and
serial bus implementation; added support for multiple display
depths under X11.  Also wrote `c1541'

<LI>

<B>Jouko Valta</B>
Copyright (C) 1993-1996
Wrote `petcat' and `c1541', `T64' handling, user service and
maintenance (most of the work in x64 0.3.x was made by him);
retired from the project in July 96, after VICE 0.10.0.

<LI>

<B>Jarkko Sonninen</B>
Copyright (C) 1993-1994
He was the founder of the project, wrote the old version of the
6502 emulation and the XDebugger, and retired from the project
after x64 0.2.1.

the very interesting "VIC article" from which we got invaluable
